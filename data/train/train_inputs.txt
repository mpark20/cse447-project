It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously.

And I guess on a certain level I want to break it off but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time?

That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think no this is what I really want so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it.
