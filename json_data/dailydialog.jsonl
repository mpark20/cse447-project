{"text": "Beh, vedrò", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "Naturalmente deve andare con il vino bianco", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "Perché? Il vino rosso non va bene con il sushi?", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "Sì", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "Il sushi è un cibo molto gustoso e il vino rosso ha un forte contrasto", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "Capisco", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "Devo portare una bottiglia di Chardonnay? È vino bianco, vero?", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "Lo Chardonnay è piuttosto forte e un po' rognoso", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "Ti suggerirei di prendere qualcosa di più leggero, come un Sauvignon Blanc della Nuova Zelanda", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "Il vino bianco del Rodano è ottimo", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "Bene", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "Di cosa è fatto?", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "Beh, è un vino francese, quindi non c'è alcuna indicazione della varietà sull'etichetta", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "I francesi considerano il suolo in cui l'uva viene coltivata come uno dei fattori più importanti nel sapore finale del vino", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "Pensi che questo sia un buon vino?", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "È uno dei nostri vini più venduti", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "Il dottore non ha detto esattamente cosa fosse", "lang": "it", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "这房子太糟糕了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也受够了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "门铃坏了，水槽漏水了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没热水了，这房子没法住了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "抱怨是没用的。如果我们有足够的钱，也不用在这受苦！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，你看起来糟透了！怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦！我觉得很不舒服。我喉咙痛，咳嗽得厉害。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，亲爱的。也许你感冒了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我最近加班很多，根本没怎么睡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那么，这个周末你应该休息一下，不要出去喝酒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我认为你是对的！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "麻烦送我去肯尼迪机场，可以吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，我的车被偷了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "下一个出租车站在哪里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不远，在那边。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "母亲节快乐，妈妈！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢！花很漂亮。你不用买花的！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我当然应该准备！您值得这些东西！您平时包容了我们做的所有事情。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我早都不记得了。要这么说的话，花我收下了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "加油！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "明天几点？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "早上七点半。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在哪里见面？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在市场。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的干杯", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "干杯", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我请客。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢。这地方不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "现在可以点菜了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，给我拿瓶葡萄酒和菲力牛排。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你要沙拉酱吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好啊，有什么样的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们有意大利式的、法式的、千岛酱和蓝奶酪。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想法式的可以。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我刚搬进公寓，水管坏了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能描述一下你的水管问题吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "浴缸里几乎没有水。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，浴室的水管需要检查一下。厨房的水管呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "厨房和浴室的水管都不好用。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这个问题已经持续很长时间了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "昨天晚上才开始。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天下午我过去看看。你那时候在家吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不在家。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可以用我的钥匙进去，但我希望你在那里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能帮我个忙吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想已经解决了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我受够了你无聊的意见。你以为你是谁！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你竟敢这样对我说话。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她告诉你这个消息时，你说了什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我平静下来。最后，我让她为这么重要的决定反省一下。我不忍心直截了当的拒绝，让她失望。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但我坚持要她忘记这一点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你怎么忍心这么做？她需要温暖和帮助。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我太兴奋了，妈妈。哦，一个新宝宝！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的第一个孙子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还是我的第一个侄子。他长得很像你，妈妈。是的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你这样认为吗？嗯，我觉得。他看起来确实很像我。哦，他的眼睛很像理查德。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，他的眼睛很像理查德。与理查德相比，孩子更像你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，孩子们一般都长得很像父母。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "确实。米歇尔在很多方面都很像亨利。和他一样，她对陌生人也很害羞。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你经常喜欢拿孩子和他们的父母做比较。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "玛丽没有通过物理期末考试。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她一定很伤心。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她父母狠狠地批评了她，她现在很沮丧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在这样的时刻，她需要的是鼓励而不是责备。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "需要帮忙吗", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想买些邮票。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想要什么样的邮票？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "寄这封信我需要花多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我必须称一下。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "多少？超重了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "超重5克。你想寄普通信还是挂号信？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那要多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "挂号加超重，一共7元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿，妈妈，看看我发现了什么！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "天哪！别把那只青蛙带到家里来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "打扰一下，我能看看这件绿外套吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。给您。这是新来的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我喜欢这个款式。我能试穿一下吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。试衣间在角落里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，戴夫。我是吉娜。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "吉娜？吉娜？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "几个月前我收到了你的电子邮件。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "啊？那是哪一个？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那个说你是个讨厌鬼的人。你别想再从我这里得到任何消息。我希望你毁了你的吉普车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。那个。还好使吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢你邀请我们。我们玩得很开心。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很高兴你来了。欢迎下次再来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢。对了，告诉你妻子她办了一个很棒的派对。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我会转达的。再见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你一个月挣多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "管好你自己。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "早上好。有什么能效劳的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们想为新房子买些家具。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这里有几套家具，包括沙发、梳妆台、衣柜和餐具柜。这套怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们喜欢大一点的衣柜。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "阿美，这是古代中国的大厅吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。看看这些历史遗迹，太神奇了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么它们都在玻璃盒子里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为了保护文物。有些文物暴露在空气中会变成尘土。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "所以玻璃盒子里没有空气吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，没有。都是真空的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想知道这些东西有多少年历史了。几千年了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，它们都来自非常古老的年代。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿，看那三脚架。我在电视上看过。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是4000年前制造的。它是无价的！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "早上好。这个月18号和20号还有小房子吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我看一下。。。一间还是两间卧室？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一间卧室就可以。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，先生。我们可以为您提供住宿。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "允许养宠物，是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，先生。狗和猫都不可以。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没问题。我没有宠物。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。18号见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请问到银行怎么走？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哪家银行？有两个，爱尔兰联合银行和爱尔兰银行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我有一张爱尔兰联合银行的卡，我想从银行取钱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那你就要去当地购物中心邓恩百货附近的爱尔兰联合银行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我怎么过去呢。我对这个地方一无所知。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "过马路，在另一边左转。沿着人行道一直走到红绿灯处。你会在右手边看到一个购物中心。穿过马路，到购物中心后右转。一直往前走大约100米，银行就在你的左边。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来太复杂了。离这儿有多远？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没那么复杂。从这里步行大约五分钟。如果你愿意，我可以给你画张地图。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太感谢了。顺便问一下，我是往南走还是往北走？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你得往北走。你现在在城市的西边，爱尔兰联合银行在东北部边。这是这个地区的大致情况。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真的很喜欢今晚的聚会。谢谢你，莎拉。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不客气，鲍勃。很高兴见到你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也很高兴（再）见到你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。那你要修头发，还是要做造型呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可以弄得像他一样吗？他的女朋友也是同样的发型，而且她是白人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "像那个拉斯塔教的祟拜者？你是说雷鬼烫？你疯了！那要花很长时间的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那你要弄什么样的发型？我们可不可以搭配一下？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我要抹些顺发剂，然后将发尾弄翘，像荷莉贝瑞一样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也可以抹些顺发剂吗？还有，你为什么说\"You crazy\"而不是\" You ou're crazy\"？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想再和你谈谈发生的事。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "啊，别了，我们别白费口舌。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你喜欢哈利波特的书和电影吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不喜欢！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？他们非常有趣，很令人兴奋。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许吧，但我觉得是给孩子们看的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，不是这样的。很多成年人也喜欢哈利波特的书。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许不符合我的口味。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你认为做生意最重要的是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，有好几件事吧。当然，你必须尽你所能降低成本，保持高收入。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那么，你认为工人的工资应该尽可能低吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不。如果你那样做，工人们就会不喜欢他们的工作。他们的工作效率会降低，你的员工流动率也会很高。这些东西会增加你的成本。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "企业如何才能最大限度地提高收入？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你需要投资一些好的广告。你必须知道你的潜在客户在哪里，并瞄准他们。把电脑游戏卖给老年人是没有用的。市场太小了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你还有什么建议？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "了解其他公司对相同产品或服务的定价。定价要低。不要比别人便宜太多，因为许多顾客相信一分价钱一分货。他们会觉得如果那么便宜，一定是劣质产品。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "打扰一下，方向盘旁边的屏幕是干什么用的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是一台便携式电视。现在很流行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，对我来说倒是新鲜事。那每天都有什么节目呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "时事新闻、纪录片、音乐节目、电影、非商业广告等。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有什么有趣的看点吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有的，会有一些不错的信息。我认为很多人低估了电视在教育中的价值。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我同意这个观点。这个电视上播广告吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。因为电视台需要从节目间隙的广告里获得收益。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很有道理。电视运转得好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不是一直这样。具体要看卫星信号的传输情况了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我明白了。看节目的话你付费吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，每月50元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有点贵，但挺值的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊。你知道的，开车很无聊。电视能让我开车不那么疲劳。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还可以让像我这样的乘客感到不无聊。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这也很重要。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好？伯尼先生。我叫丽莎。希望我没有打扰你。我刚听说你女儿的事。我想打电话给你，告诉你我们都很想念她。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起。我想你打错电话了。我不是伯尼先生。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么？真奇怪。如果打扰了你，我很抱歉。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "斯蒂芬妮！你刚到学校吗？但是今天早上我离开宿舍的时候你已经起床了！那是一个半小时前的事了。你总这样！为什么你早上花那么长时间准备？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是一种技巧，我能说什么？我也不知道为什么，只是例行公事。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请解释一下，因为我觉得毫无意义。一个女孩的日常生活怎么会这么复杂？你起床，洗澡，穿衣服，刷牙，就可以出门了，最多半小时。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "雅各布，你头发不怎么需要造型。而我不一样。我得留出大约一个半小时在早晨准备。每天醒来就直接洗澡。隔一天洗一次头。洗头发需要洗两次，因为会很油。然后我一般会放护发素，然后冲掉。我头发太长了，一般洗澡都要超过二十分钟。之后，我一般泡一壶咖啡，然后穿上衣服，等着煮咖啡。早上穿衣服时间花很久。我有时候记得会在前一天晚上选衣服，但一般是在早上。总的来说，穿衣服大约需要半个小时，这个时候我的头发是半干，所以必须要造型了。有时弄直有时候卷发。然后，因为我头发质地问题，我经常要熨平防止它卷曲。这又需要二十分钟左右。之后再化妆。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯嗯，我很少看到你不理头发不化妆，哪怕穿着运动裤来上课。你早上要花多长时间来选择衣服？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这一点都不好笑。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "需要我帮忙吗", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想买一双鞋。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你穿多大码？这些鞋在打折。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我穿36号的。 这双看起来不错。 我可以试穿一下吗?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然可以。它们看起来不错。 而且也不贵。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "它们多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "168美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我买了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得那个人刚才的演讲怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别相信他，他就是个骗子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "政客们的话没有一句是真的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "亲爱的，你想来点吐司吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "敬酒吗，亲爱的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你高兴就好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想喝茶吗，亲爱的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对我来说没什么区别。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，你没听我说话。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你别管我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你认为奥林匹克格言\"更高、更快、更强\"怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，这比\"友谊第一，比赛第二\"要好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？在我看来，赢不赢无关紧要。最重要的是参与。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我还是觉得没人不想得奖。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "万分感谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道英语演讲比赛谁赢了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不对，谁当选了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是乔治。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的？真想不到是他。我不知道他的英语那么好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的驾驶考试考得好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "考得很好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是说我通过了考试吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我正要跟你说。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我搞砸了什么吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有一项你确实没做好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "告诉我是什么。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你平行停车有点问题。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这不容易。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这才是你真正需要努力的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我还能拿到驾照吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "会有到的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "妈妈，你知道我和安德里亚有时会担心你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的吗？你为什么要担心我？我很好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "妈妈，你快70岁了！你不觉得搬来和我们一起住对你更好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不会！我喜欢我的公寓，我喜欢独立。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你一个人住会感到孤独吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一点也不。我一周见你和你的家人两次，我喜欢见我自己的朋友。我太忙了，不觉得寂寞！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "到目前为止你喜欢这套公寓吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我发现一个问题。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有什么问题吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我发现到厨房的水龙头漏水了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那没什么。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的水费账单来的时候，就成问题了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想让我怎么处理？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我希望你能解决好这个问题。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我现在没法解决。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，问题解决之前我不会租这套公寓的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，我帮你修一下。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很高兴达成了协议。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "珍妮，我想去野餐。你想来吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很乐意。我喜欢野餐。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那就，穿上你的休闲服，打包一些食物和饮料。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我能带上相机吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。请带足够的胶卷。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我当然会的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢这个风格，但是腰有点紧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给您这件大号的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这个很合适，但是太贵了。能便宜一点吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在花园里种什么东西？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我种了各种各样的东西，所以有些东西一年四季都在开花。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的花园什么时候开的最好？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "春天最美，梅花和樱花都开了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿，杰克。你对新工作感到兴奋吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊。我真的很期待。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哪一件事让你更兴奋，上大学还是上班？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "差不多，但兴奋的点不同。我没法回答。你呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对我来说，我觉得开学更令人兴奋。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那是不是意味着工作没那么好？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "有时男人们会穿艳丽的颜色。你认为今年哪些电影会获奖？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "它是一种水果。中间有很大的核。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "核能吃吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不能。你会把你的牙齿都嚼坏的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这些芒果多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "参赛者是不同的。这些女孩的表演风格都很自由。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你有很多时间看电视吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得有不到3个小时。今年我没有看任何娱乐节目。因为节目之间的广告太多了。我更喜欢听收音机。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也不喜欢广告。但是广告可以给电视台带来巨大的利润。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果他们的广告做的漂亮的话，我能忍受。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "这个看起来不错，但我还想多看看。你还有别的建议吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这个也很酷。这是个科幻游戏，你得阻止外星人入侵，画质也是美轮美奂。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，太难选择了，但我会选择这个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你上次考试考得怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "是的。如果你很会唱歌，听众会听得很舒服，对吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我完全同意你的观点。如果你唱得很难听，那会很搞笑。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我记得汤姆总是走调。我们会突然大笑起来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的吗？我们邀请他和我们一起去好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太狡猾了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在做什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我在计算我的预算。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么预算？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我正在做购物预算，这样就不会花太多钱了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能花多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我一个月只能花300美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么只有300美元？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "剩下的我要留着。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "您尝过这种吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有，这种烟太烈了，我想要淡一点的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这个怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这符合我口味，我要这个。你们有打火机吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有很多种。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给我看看那个塑料的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我把它拿过来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今晚有什么好菜吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们有松鼠桂鱼、虾仁等。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很好，我们都要了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "约翰尼，你又在闲坐了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我只是在洗窗户和打扫厕所之间休息一下。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你不过就是把窗户上的灰尘移到脸上和手上。真丢人！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我已经尽力了，奶奶", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还不够好，我那个年代，牙刷和唾沫都可以清洁整个医院，要比你这个\"猪圈\"干净两倍！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，好吧", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "打扰一下，下一班去波士顿的巴士什么时候开？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "8点出发。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道了。有空位吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请稍等。对。你可以买一张票。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很好。我们要多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "三十八美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧。这是四十美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是您的票和零钱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢。我该去哪个门乘公共汽车？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "去2号门。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不客气。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "天哪，我迟到了。我必须在早上8点之前到办公室。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的吗，怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有一个和新客户的重要会面。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，你一定要保持冷静。要我载你一程吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你不必那么做，但确实能帮我一个大忙。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，等一下。我得想一想我把钥匙放在哪里了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "山姆，我的股票怎么办？我会赔钱吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有可能。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你这是什么意思？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的意思是，如果你现在不卖掉你的股票，你很有可能最终会血本无归。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是这样吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。相信我的话。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们晚上吃什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你打算做什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我今晚没打算做饭。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果你饿了那就做点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道做什么。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "告诉我你想吃什么。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我一直馋鸡肉和土豆。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也喜欢吃。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那你今天晚上做吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我今天晚上真的不打算做饭。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那好吧，那我做。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那你现在怎么不开始做呀？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在那里做什么笔记。我觉得像是涂鸦。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是教授今天教的概念的图像联想。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这真的对你有用吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我还不确定。星期五考试后我会告诉你的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢用速记笔记。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有人以前告诉我，你花在写作上的时间越多，你的注意力就越少，所以你会错过一些东西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯。我从来没有这样想过。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有一次我试着只听，没有记笔记，没有拍照。我觉得那天我真的学到了更多东西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，谢谢你，帕里先生，谢谢你提供的所有信息。还有一个问题。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您好，先生？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你平时做什么运动或游戏吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我上大学的时候经常踢足球，夏天我经常做田径运动。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你参加了什么运动？你还记得吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我是个长跑运动员。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "现在呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不。恐怕我结婚后就没有时间了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，再次感谢你来参加面试。但请记住，我们喜欢新入职的同事可以加入公司的足球队踢球。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，先生", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "丹尼尔，我跟不上英语老师的进度。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有什么问题吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你英语很好，你能帮我吗。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系。但是你最好找个英语学校补课。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "英语学校？那是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这种学校可以帮助你提高英语水平。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那和我们学校的英语课不同吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，在你开始上课之前，他们会先测试你的英语水平。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想我可以向你租这间公寓。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很高兴听到你这么说。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想租多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "每个月你要付1050美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那太贵了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我认为这租金不算太高。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得每月850美元怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还不够。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是我的最低价了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "每月850美元不够。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请你重新考虑一下好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是我最后的报价。要么接受，要么放弃。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "司机，带我去机场。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "司机，你能开快点吗？恐怕我会误了班机。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，女士，有限速。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "该死的！我想我要赶不上飞机了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很抱歉。你的航班时间是几点？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "两点钟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别担心，夫人。我觉得我们不会迟于下午1:30到达那里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的吗？太棒了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们到了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给你钱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "等一下。这是找你的钱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可以为您点菜了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这家的特色菜是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "番茄酱烤鱼不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢鱼。请给我点一份。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想吃甜点吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请给我苹果派。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "单人房还是双人房？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "两个吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "杰克，听说你升职了。是真的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。我觉得我很幸运。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，杰克，你应得的。你一直在努力工作。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你这么说。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你喜欢这部电影吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，剧情非常拖沓。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不好意思。我觉得这比在《金色池塘》要好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "见鬼去吧！没有人会给它颁发奥斯卡奖！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大卫，你有什么新鲜事吗？你心情不太好。可以和我说说吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "六个月后，我的大学生活就要结束了。接下来的麻烦就是要找工作。真让人头疼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别把事情看得那么严重，我的朋友！我们每个人都会遇到麻烦，找工作是不可避免的。别紧张！相信自己，总有一天你会成功的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来是这样的。也许我应该看到好的一面。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "比尔，你的运动水平如何？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在开玩笑吗？我糟透了！但我喜欢看体育比赛。我经常看足球或棒球比赛。我每周都看体育杂志。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哇！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你喜欢运动吗，珍妮丝？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，是的。我喜欢运动。但我不看体育比赛也不买买体育杂志。我没有太多时间做那些事。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我明白了。你知道，我们喜欢的运动不同。你花多少时间锻炼身体？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我每天锻炼两个小时左右。我每周做三次有氧运动，其余几天我和我丈夫打羽毛球。运动完我总是感觉很好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太棒了！我以前听人说过。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你为什么不试着锻炼一下呢？这很难，但很有收获。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我懒得运动，而且我什么都不擅长。我对运动不感兴趣。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当她告诉我除了迪克她谁也不嫁时，我的心都提到嗓子眼儿了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你也害怕？我不敢告诉你我听到那件事时的感受。我差点晕倒了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不明白，也搞不懂她为什么会看上迪克那样的男人。他和很多女孩暧昧不清。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但是莎拉说她不在乎，只要他爱她就行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我通常打八号球，轻的球容易控制，可以更强劲旋转，这样球会走出弧形，然后我就能在打球时随心所欲的控制它。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好。我喜欢重一点的。我没有那么多的控制力，通常是直投，但额外的冲力会弥补我控球能力的不足。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，让我们看看哪种技术更好。我想先来。。。好！我打了一个全中。我一下就都击倒了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "做得好。你都击中了。得到10分，接下来的两个球加到这一回合的分数上。我要把球擦干，再来一次全中。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好球。你击中了八个。剩下的是7分，10分。除非你能投出飞碟球，否则不可能赢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我当然可以试试。。。不！它径直穿过了边门。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我不在乎。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "爸爸，今晚有什么好玩的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们要去见史密斯夫人，帮助她忙活院子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "院子里的活？我说‘我们做什么好玩的'，不是工作！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "会很有趣的。而且，你会在最好的公司。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "爸爸。你真可爱。我需要做什么来帮你准备呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以把耙子和铲子放在一起，我再放到车里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "牛穿仔裤和T恤，对吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，还可以穿件夹克以防降温。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请加满高级油。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，需要我检查一下你的散热器吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用，没关系。要付多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "150元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，凯特。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，唐。真是个惊喜！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我看到有人走路和你很像，但我不确定。我们有多久没见面了？快三个月了？但你现在看起来完全不一样了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你注意到有什么变化了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，你看起来很苗条，更活泼。你吃了什么？你在节食吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。我正在节食，但什么也没吃。我只是少吃多动。三个月来，真的很管用。我瘦了十二磅。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哇！那太好了。我真心想达到我的减肥目标，但是我很难坚持锻炼。你也知道，老习惯很难改掉。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你认为我做什么运动？我只是每天下班后去跳舞。我在上业余舞蹈课。我每天跳舞两小时。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "跳舞？你只去跳舞？这并不难。我能做到。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对啊。下周来我的班上课吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那么，你和理查德出去了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "太好吃了，炖羊肉味道好极了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也喜欢。我特别喜欢鱼。太鲜了，味道有点像淡水鱼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，这里的食物名副其实。中国菜是我的最爱之一", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果你愿意的话，下次我带你去一家新餐馆，我朋友告诉我的，他对那家店赞不绝口。这道川蔡很棒。你想试试吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然，我想的。我听说川菜很辣，我想我会很喜欢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了，我也喜欢热食。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，让我们先吃完这顿丰盛的晚餐吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说的对。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很抱歉我迟到了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你应该安静地站在这里直到升旗仪式结束。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我大约什么时候可以回去上课？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "都结束的时候。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "现在一切都结束了。我现在可以走了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还没有。你再站几分钟。迟到者必须记名。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太糟糕了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你认为谁演得最好？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那个老人的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "完全同意！那正是我最喜欢的角色。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有些场景让我感动得流下了眼泪。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你确定这辆公交车到圣安妮塔购物中心吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你确定？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我一直坐这辆车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "要坐很久吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大约三十分钟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道我们在哪儿下车吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "梅西百货后面就有一站。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的吗，商场旁边有一站？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "商场停车场有一站。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那很方便。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很担心你的车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没事的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我能帮你解决。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用了，真没事。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你开车技术好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我很会开车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我需要你教教我怎么开车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好，但是你有学员许可证吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你以前开过车吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我以前开过车，但只开过一次。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你认识车里所有的控制装置吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "已经都认识了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想让我什么时候开始教你？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你什么时候有时间？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "明天打电话给我吧，然后我们就开始。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "艾丽斯，你父亲真了不起。他90岁了，一个人住在那所大房子里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道。他不喜欢向任何人求助。我爸爸坚持自己付账，自己照顾自己！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来像我祖母。她总是独立得近乎固执。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "似乎像我父亲和你祖母这样的人都决心要靠自己。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们把独立看作是一种性格特点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有时他们太独立了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想把你的公寓租出去。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那太好了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "租金是多少？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "每月租金是1050美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那可是一大笔钱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想好价钱了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "800美元怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太低了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我承担不起。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一个月900美元怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "周四可以。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真不错，很高兴和你做生意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你们有新出炉的甜甜圈出售吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们将在半小时内出炉。你还需要什么吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我还要五个羊角面包。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "3美元40美分。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我怕我忘了锁门。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你太粗心了，比利。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，妈妈，我马上锁上。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我已经为你锁好了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这里是红餐厅。您想预约吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯嗯，我想订一张今晚两人桌。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么时候？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "7:30，顺便说一下，我想要一张靠窗的桌子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没问题，先生。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可以请你和我跳舞吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，我不会跳舞。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系，我可以教你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "学起来难吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，很简单。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我该怎么办？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "像我这样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧。顺便问一下，你经常跳舞吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，因为跳舞可以让我放松。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是个好办法。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能帮我一下吗？我搬不动这个重箱子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "恐怕不行。你没看见我在用字典查单词吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得你只是在快速翻阅字典。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，那你等我一下。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们今天开车去兜风好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "感觉晚些时候要下雨了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许你是对的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们明天去。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，天哪！我看起来很老。我看起来好像40岁。我想是时候做整形手术了。我厌倦了这些皱纹和下垂的皮肤。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我没有看到任何皱纹或下垂的皮肤！你最好别这么荒唐了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不管怎样，我想我还需要隆鼻和隆胸。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想你需要做个脑部手术。老实说，你看起来很迷人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道你的意思。我只想让自己更有魅力。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你现在的样子很好。另外，整形手术也很痛。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真正的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。所以你最好摆脱这个想法。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "夫人，我能为您效劳吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想买一件新的冬衣。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你有什么特别想要的颜色吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真的不知道。今年流行什么颜色？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "红色很受欢迎。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很好。红色很适合我。红色是一种欢快的颜色，对不对？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，女士，我同意。您的尺码是多少？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我以前穿14号的，但最近体重增加了一点，所以可能是16号。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给你，女士。这些都是16码的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很喜欢这个。多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "180美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太贵了。没有更便宜的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "夫人，这是我们最便宜的外套。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，我明白了。我要了。给你200美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是找你的钱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "打扰一下，方向盘旁边的屏幕是干什么用的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是一台便携式电视。现在很流行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，对我来说倒是新鲜事。那每天都有什么节目呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "时事新闻、纪录片、音乐节目、电影、非商业广告等。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有什么有趣的看点吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有的，会有一些不错的信息。我认为很多人低估了电视在教育中的价值。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我同意这个观点。这个电视上播广告吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。因为电视台需要从节目间隙的广告里获得收益。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很有道理。电视运转得好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不是一直这样。具体要看卫星信号的传输情况了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我明白了。看节目的话你付费吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，每月50元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想试试炒股。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道，这很难。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别担心。我知道天上不会掉馅饼。我会努力的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "祝你好运！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么这么难过？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "弗兰克又和露西出去了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "人们都说露西是交际花。你知道的，很多有钱人带她去兜风。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "怎么了，鲍勃？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能不能陪我去舞会？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然，我会的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了。我八点来接你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得华尔兹怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很漂亮，我很喜欢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可以请你跳第一支舞吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的荣幸。但我恐怕不太会跳舞。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "其实，我最近也开始跳舞了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，真的吗？但你跳探戈跳得很好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很高兴你这么说，你跳得也很漂亮。很幸运我有个搭档。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你的夸奖。只是你是个好领导。你喜欢桑巴舞和华尔兹舞吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "喜欢。你最喜欢什么舞蹈？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "华尔兹是我的最爱，胜过其他所有舞蹈。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，音乐停了。谢谢和我跳舞。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的荣幸。我们去喝一杯吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "欢迎来到加兰特。有什么能帮到您的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好。我想为我的房子办理一下网络业务。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。我们有三种不同的方案，你可以选择价格不同。第一个是最便宜但最基本的计划，每月三十美元。这是宽带互联网，下载速度为512kbps。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道kbps是什么意思。我只想上网，玩游戏，和朋友聊天。哦，还有在线看电影。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，那这个连接可能有点太慢了。我建议你以每月50美元的价格购买高级套餐，其中包括2兆字节的连接速度。这样你就可以在网上玩游戏而不会有任何延迟。这个套餐还包括一个无线路由器和绝对免费的个人防火墙！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我需要付安装费吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你很幸运，这个月我们不收以往的安装费。你现在就省了100块钱！我们还附赠这个U盘！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这么棒！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你敢信，我们的车位卖了四千块！太棒了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们放点音乐吧！我想跳舞。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那正是我所想的，月光和舞蹈。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "啊！这才像话。真有气氛！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "来吧，宝贝，让我们跳舞！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哎呀！房东来了。情况有变，我们成吵人的邻居了。关小点声！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "能把宽翻领那件夹克递给我吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以。给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您还满意吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很时髦！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能把车借给我吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没门儿。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "圣诞快乐，亲爱的。你哥哥喜欢台湾吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "瑞安说他想留下来。我想他爱上了一个设计水果盘的女孩。。。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不！没有他的圣诞节已经够糟了。那么，亲爱的，你临阵退缩了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊，尤其是因为杰克不负责预订机票。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你不来了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "31号前不来。你能改变教堂的预定吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "恐怕不行。这座教堂的客满到2001年。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我们在哪里举行婚礼呢？在家里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们必须这么做。我们将在1号排练，2号举行婚礼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，妈妈。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别担心，亲爱的。我是个很棒的主人。现在休息一下。圣诞快乐。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "圣诞快乐，妈妈。我爱你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也爱你。原谅杰克。他已经尽力了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道。晚安。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太可怕了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在说什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "难道你看不到许多父母强迫孩子去学一些他们认为很重要的东西吗。但孩子们对此一点兴趣都没有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说的对。许多父母就是不知道如何教育他们的孩子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想买这双鞋。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "总共104", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "99美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "标价是99", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "99美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的小姐，但是马里兰州有百分之五的营业税。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真傻，竟然忘了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没事，您想怎么付钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "现金。在这儿，给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "收款110", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "00美元，找零5", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "01美元。谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你对报纸有何评论？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "报纸上的社论总是一语中的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你不觉得有点保守吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "毕竟，我有点保守。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "迈克，你中彩票了吗？为什么要笑呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真是松了一口气。我刚通过律师资格考试。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是吗？太棒了！你现在一定很高兴吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不夸张地说，我人已经在九霄云外了。我太高兴了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你告诉你父母了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还没有。我没联系到他们。我今晚再给他们打次电话。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们可能会非常高兴。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得也是。今天真是美好的一天。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你喜欢花吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然，我喜欢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你最喜欢什么花？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "连翘。又叫迎春花，是春天到来的象征。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "春天是个热闹的季节。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的。你呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我非常欣赏梅花。似乎只有它才能在寒冷的冬天盛开。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你真有品位！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "它象征着无畏寒冬。我欣赏梅花的坚韧不拔。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但它曾经被许多人忽视。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "智者永远不会忘记它。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，下雪了。下雪时让我们欣赏梅花吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这地方还不错，但你得买些家具。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我本来打算去的。我可以从我家带一些来。我父母家还有一些。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你有床吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然有。在我的老房子里有一个。我父母家还有一个大学用的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那很好。你可以把一个放在这个房间里，另一个放在那个房间里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，这是个好主意。如果你愿意，可以在我家过夜。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊。对了，我能洗个澡吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以，但这里还没有热水。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真正的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，他们明天早上来通煤气。我的电话到时候应该也能用了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想出去吃晚饭吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好啊，反正我明天才能做饭。我们去附近的餐馆吧。我请客。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以，走吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "鲍勃在家吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起。你打错电话了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "把衣服晾出去。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但是下雨了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你今晚想去看电影吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然！看什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "新的《暮光之城》！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "《暮光》？就像吸血鬼电影里那样？算了吧，我正在看，但我不明白为什么大家都这么喜欢有关吸血鬼的电影。这不合理。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这很合理。它就像现代的罗密欧和朱丽叶。你可以看到一对相爱但却不能在一起的情侣，因为他们太不一样了。事实上，永生和超能力的设定使人物更加性感，你听着！加上演员都很时尚，使得电影更有吸引力。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不信。我认为这只是一种时尚。很快就会过去，人人都会喜欢狼人或僵尸！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你们国家最流行的运动是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "乒乓球。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你打乒乓球吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不打，但我喜欢看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的表每天总是快十分钟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真有趣。我的表每天总是慢十分钟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的假的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我是认真的。每天早上我用收音机调表，但还是慢了十分钟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道怎么办才好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "扔掉，买一个新的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，没必要。你每天只需要把表放回十分钟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "所以你每天把表往后拨十分钟？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我就是这么做的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么要这么麻烦？买块新表就行了。花费不多。再说了，我也不想忍受这件事了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的电脑坏了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有什么问题吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我正打算开机，但是开不了了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "检查一下连接试试。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么的连接？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "CPU后面插在插座上的电线。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不能开机是因为这个吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果这个电线没有接好，就开不了机。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道这事。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您检查一下连接。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我试试。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "要是不管用再跟我说。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，马丁。我整个上午都在找你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想和你道别。我明天要去美国。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "美国？你被麻省理工学院录取了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "祝贺你！苏珊。我真为你高兴。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真的会想你的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也是。我一落脚就给你写信。但我有很多事要做。你可能得等一会儿。但我真的会写信给你。我喜欢写信。我认为它比电子邮件，甚至比电话更有意义。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的保重。旅途愉快。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "照顾好你自己。再见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "再见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "比尔，万圣节快乐！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "万圣节快乐！你要扮成什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我要扮成长着大尖牙的吸血鬼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可以看看你的服装吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。等一下（几分钟后）给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢你的黑衣服，尖牙很酷。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今晚我要咬很多漂亮女孩的脖子。也许我会吸他们的血。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哈哈。祝你好运。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他喜欢那个金发女孩。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，他曾经送了她七朵玫瑰。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她接受了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不知道。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我能载你回家吗，沃德太太？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "李先生，你真是太好了。非常感谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我把钥匙拿出来的时候，你能帮我撑伞吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。今晚真糟糕，不是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊，非常可怕。好了，门现在开着。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "打扰一下，我需要一个旧音乐盒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想要多旧的盒子？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "20世纪20年代。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们还有六个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "盒子里有舞者吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "舞者很受欢迎。有两个盒子有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢舞者。我要这个音乐盒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以，我想你会很满意的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有保修单吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有。但如果出了问题，我有认识的人会修理。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我只是希望有保修单。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "令人惊讶的是，这些东西仍然像以前一样工作。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "业主们是否对我买房提出的还价作出了回应？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "作为对你方报价的回应，卖方决定还价三十三万五千美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来不错，但我不知道如何决定。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以接受这个提议，也可以拒绝，然后再提出另一个报价。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果我提出另一个报价，他们拒绝了，那会怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "就我个人而言，我会考虑再提出一个报价，但你自己决。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们试着用一下报价三十三万美元吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我将与卖家联系，告知你方最新报价。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你认为会进展得很快吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "通常，对第二个报价的反应比第一个报价的反应要快一点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好。请原谅我。你知道这附近有没有商业银行吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有，沿着北京路一直走，然后右转。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一直往前走，然后右转。很远吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，只要几分钟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不客气", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "下周放假对吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，星期一。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你打算做什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可能要逛一天看车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "车？你不会是要买车吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊，我想多出去转转。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但在现在买车很贵吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我不知道。当然，现在汽油很贵。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但停车怎么办？你可不能把车停在大街上？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很多人都停街上呀。但不管怎么说，我也试试，我肯定不想付太多停车费。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "继母很坏。她无法忍受男孩脸上露出幸福的笑容。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "然后呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "然后她尽了最大努力去拔掉了她身上的刺，男孩失去了所有让他高兴的东西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可怜的孩子！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是摔跤手还是拳击手？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "都不是。为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你肌肉发达的肩膀和胸部给我留下了深刻的印象。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，真的吗？我每天都去健身房。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得很不舒服。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你病了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有。是老师在黑板上拖拽粉笔的声音真让我觉得难受。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他马上就写完。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一张公交卡多少钱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "月卡65美元", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有便宜点的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有学生卡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "学生卡多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "学生卡免费。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "完全免费吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "月付贴纸需要花钱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "多少钱呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "每个月买张新贴纸要花24美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我买学生公交卡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我去给你拿。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那女人又被打了。她为什么不报警。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "因为打她的是她的丈夫。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太不可思议了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她说家丑不可外扬。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你们公司加入工会了吗？我听说我们行业的很多公司都加入了工会，所以在公平的环境下竞争越来越难。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我们也赶时髦，加入了工会。大多数人对此非常高兴…我想这取决于你属于管理层还是劳动阶层。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想，管理层对工会的看法不太好。我不怪他们。。。工会真的会对高管施加压力。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。。。但这对工人来说可能更好，因为工会的宗旨是帮助弱者。弱者要对付大老板的唯一办法就是团结起来。工会都在为弱者争取发言权。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "下午好，先生。我能帮您什么忙吗?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想把这个包裹寄到美国。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想空运还是海运？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "海运。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太棒了，是吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是我多年来最有趣的一次。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们应该经常见面。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我们就应该这样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，我迟到了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，没关系。我只是想知道原因。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我坐的公交车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你什么意思？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我坐错车了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，是吗？坐车并不难。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "宇宙中的星系在太空中运动吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，星系或多或少被动地坐落在它所在的空间里。但不是所有。当星系间的空间膨胀时，它会把星系分离地更远——就像膨胀面团中的葡萄干。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但我听说我们的银河系有朝一日可能会与邻近的星系相撞。如果星系彼此分离，它们怎么会碰撞？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，宇宙是一个混乱的地方，来自一个星系或一组星系的引力，可能会干扰其邻近星系的运动，导致它们相撞。然而，平均而言，当你比较两个足够大的星系空间块时，它们其实在不断远离。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哇，你见识真广。谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不客气", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以等一会儿吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，要多久？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不确定。但我会尽快把桌子收拾好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的我们等着。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起。你能帮我一下吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。我能帮你什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我在找一件毛衣。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你穿多大号的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得是中码。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得这个怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很漂亮。我能试穿一下吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以在那边试衣间试穿。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请给我8美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是10美元。 不用找了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "晚上好，小姐。想买袜子吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对，有长袜吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有，但我建议你买连裤袜，长袜已经过时了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。连裤袜是人造丝材质吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想吃一块生日蛋糕吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用了，谢谢，我就不吃了。不过看起来很好吃。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我以为你很喜欢吃奶霜草莓蛋糕呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "确实很喜欢。但我在节食，不可以吃草莓奶霜蛋糕。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "节食？为什么？你身材这么好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "前几天我去看医生了，他说我胆固醇升高了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦哦，听起来还蛮严重。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不太严重，但让我严格控制饮食来降低胆固醇。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你买战机2了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对啊！发行那天我就买了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你认为它怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这游戏很不错。有很多新角色。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "贵吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大约三十英镑。大多数游戏都这个价。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "机甲勇士很不错。画质很酷！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我懂。我超喜欢这个游戏。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我室友总想玩。但我让她自己去买。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我室友喜欢看我玩。他说这跟看电影一样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我从没见过这么好的画质。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也从没在游戏里听到过这么好音效。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我饿死了！我们去吃点东西吧！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想吃薯片配辣番茄酱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也是！这里的薯片又轻又脆。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们也有新鲜的辣酱。我已经流口水了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我去拿薯片。你想喝点什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你点吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以结账了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，给你。总共84美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "包括小费吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不。先生，分开收费的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给你。不用找了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有什么事吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我需要一本护照。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你需要申请一个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我什么时候能申请？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果你想的话，现在就可以。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请填写这张申请表。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "然后呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我给你拍张照就行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的护照要多久才能好？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "几周后你就能拿到。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "寄一封航空信到日本要多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我得检查一下。还有什么需要我帮忙的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想要一张20美分的邮票。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天有什么特色菜?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "酸甜排骨，夫人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们要两个人份的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "马上，夫人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不好意思，我有点迷路了。我坐哪路车到石大？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我看看。从这里开始，你得乘278路公共汽车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，好的，我在哪下车？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你应该在石大第一站下车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，谢谢……", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是新来的吧吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不是，坐车很难吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，很简单。上车后，只要问司机什么时候付车费，在哪里下车就行了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这要多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "每节才15台币。哦，看，那是你的车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哇，真是太感谢你了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很好，谢谢。你呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我没事。这些天你在干什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "其实没什么。工作很忙-我们在马来西亚有一个大项目要做。几周后我可能要去吉隆坡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了。你什么时候出发？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可能一两周后。我会告诉你的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "打扰一下。我可以进来吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。进来吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你认为台湾的经济状况如何？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "其实不太好，人们的消费没有以前那么多了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道为什么吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想有很多原因，现在失业率很高。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们在赛前要举办野餐聚会，你要参加吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以。但什么是野餐聚会？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有人开了一辆卡车来比赛，我们就在停车场的卡车后面烧烤！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "多有趣啊！我要带什么吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别担心！五点来就行了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我做的土豆沙拉很好吃！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，如果你坚持的话，欢迎你带土豆沙拉来！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我们五点在停车场见！谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "那里不是很冷吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，挪威的北部总是很冷，但再往南一点，夏天就相当暖和了。这是一个多雨的国家，所以冬天几乎到处都下雪。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我去过其他斯堪的纳维亚国家，但没去过挪威。也许我应该去那里尝试一些冰雪运动。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "你不会迟到的。现在还早。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，我不能一直呆到下课。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么事情比上课更重要？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我有个约会。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你怎么补课？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不补了，但我会保证有人帮我补上这节课的内容。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你要马上走吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我现在就走。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，但请记住你必须要赶上进度。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢，教授。我保证一切都会妥善处理。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "再见，别再缺课了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "(与约瑟夫共进午餐)你受邀吃过中国菜吗?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。北京人以热情好客著称。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在你看来，在中国吃饭是一种独特的体验吗？和在你的家乡吃饭有多大的不同？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "首先，我得用筷子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但你现在看起来已经用得相当熟练了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然了。毕竟我在这里已经两年了。对一个外国人来说，习惯中国的餐具并不难。不过，我确实不知道在中国餐桌上该如何举止得体。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，餐桌礼仪。有许多规则，如果不告诉外国人，他们是不会知道的。有些做法在西方人看来甚至有些尴尬或粗鲁，但在中国却是家常便饭。嘿，你的筷子，老傻瓜!你不应该把它们垂直插在饭碗里!", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这有什么奇怪的吗?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许你应该把它们水平地放在你的碗或盘子上。它们像两根香烛，用于祭祀。这是非常不吉利的，可能会激怒所有在场的人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，对不起！即使是一双筷子可能也大有来历。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "约翰，看目录。我想买这件红衬衫。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你不是有一件同款蓝色的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊，但我没有红色的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你需要彩虹里的每一种颜色吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "啧啧……女人啊！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好，我想寄这个包裹。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请问里面有什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "就几件衬衫。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，现在你可以打包了。另外麻烦填一下这张表格，一会儿填也可以。要寄挂号的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用了，平邮就可以。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "九美元五十美分。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是收据。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不客气", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我听说你明天要去美国。我去机场送你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，非常感谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么时候走？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "下午1:30。但我必须在12:30值机。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么航空公司，哪个航班？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "泛美航空公司。282次航班。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "下午12:30在机场见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的明天见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你终于来了！怎么花了这么长时间？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我又堵车了。家乐福十字路口附近发生了严重拥堵。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "交通高峰期那里总是很堵。也许你应该换条路回家。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "老实说，我觉得这是无法避免的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果你坐公交上班，也许会好点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想我必须考虑一下问题了。公交很好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对环境也有好处。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道。我一想到我的车向大气排放了那么多的废气,我就心情很差。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "坐地铁比开车压力小得多。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "唯一的问题是，我会怀念拥有汽车的自由。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，天气好的时候，你就可以骑自行车去上班了。这会像开车一样自由。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也对，这样也能锻炼身体！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那么，你打算不开车上班了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，这对我和环境都不好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "亲爱的，你想来点吐司吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "敬酒吗，亲爱的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你高兴就好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想喝茶吗，亲爱的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对我来说没什么区别。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，你没听我说话。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你别管我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真不敢相信！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "怎么了？那球进得漂亮。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，但是我在美洲狮身上赌了200美元！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "看来你要输了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真不敢相信！我以为美洲狮肯定会赢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可能性有多大？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "20比1，赌美洲狮赢！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太糟糕了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "抱歉，请问下口红多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "只要25元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，太贵了。能再便宜一点吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "格很合理了，因为质量很好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但是价格还是太贵了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那你想要多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "15元怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们各让一半，20元好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，我要了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的很划算。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，亲爱的！你简直不敢相信！我的朋友朱莉和亚历克斯要结婚了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哇，真是个好消息！他们很配！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道！反正，我刚和亚历克斯的伴郎谈过，他正在组织单身派对，一定会很有趣的！所有的伴郎都打算在那天晚上做些古怪而疯狂的事情。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你不会去脱衣舞俱乐部吧？我不想让你找个脱衣舞女跳大腿舞，还找借口说这是你朋友的聚会。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "噢，怎么可能！只是单纯找点乐子！你知道单身派对是什么样的！我们要玩喝酒游戏，再给他买些恶作剧礼物，好好玩玩。没什么过分的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我可不知道。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "拜托！如果你有朋友要结婚，你去参加单身派对我也不会介意的！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很好，我的朋友温迪要结婚了，我负责组织聚会！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们坐公汽去王府井吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "最好乘地铁。它更快，更方便。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，这对我来说将是一次新的经历。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们这里有相当完善的地铁系统。乘地铁几乎可以很快到达任何地方，尤其是在一天中交通繁忙的时候。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们在哪里付车费？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "只要给站在那里的人3块钱，他就会给你一个代币。然后，你把它塞进旋转栅门的槽里，推旋转栅门进去。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我来付吧。我在哪能买到地铁地图？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "让卖代币的工人给你一个。这是免费的。其实，大多数车站都张贴了显示地铁线路的地图。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "换车需要付额外的车费吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用。火车来了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们一定是你的父母，他们是干什么的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我妈妈是教授，爸爸是经理。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们经常带你出去吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，他们总是很忙。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "能不能请你帮我办张借书证。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然，请填好这张表，写完告诉我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我写完了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我还需要你的驾照；请把填好的表格给我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，表格都填好了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很好。你知道图书馆的开放时间和借阅规则吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "卡片和传单上有你需要的知道的所有信息。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很好！现在你可以好好使用图书馆了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "打得好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不错。但今天对我来说太热了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我知道。有点难以集中注意力，不是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。你在和谁打？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，就我一个人。我刚加入，所以没有同伴。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的？哦，好吧，那样的话我们应该找个时间一起打。你多大了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "16", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不是吧！我也16岁了。我们以后一定要一起打。我叫鲍勃。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我叫简。很高兴认识你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也是。你喜欢这门课吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "喜欢。不过，我个人认为果岭之间的球道有点长了，尤其是在这样炎热的天气。他们没有手推车吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，以前有，但为了环保，他们不用了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，好吧。我想球童们都很高兴。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "实际上，在我看来，推车更好，因为你不必给推车小费。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，但从这个角度来看，不用推车可能会给当地人增加就业机会，这是一件好事，对吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可能吧，但我还是很想要推车！让我烦恼的是高温使球童们的生活相当艰难。上周有个会员的球童晕倒了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真糟糕，可怜的家伙。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的。幸好他在十八洞，离俱乐部很近，没走多远就把球童抬走了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，天哪，真的吗！他把球童背回去了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好，我是温迪。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，温迪。我是格瑞。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，格瑞。我能帮你什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "玛丽莎在吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯嗯，但是她现在很忙。你能晚点再打给她吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧。我待会再打给她。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢，再见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "再见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你赞成在春假期间去旅行吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我就想这么做。你打算去哪里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "黄山怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好主意！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我听说迈克尔可能会成为新的销售经理。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是怎么知道这个谣言的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可没造谣。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们别再说闲话了，回去工作吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好！你的出租车上有人吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有，这辆出租车是免费的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请送我到红宁宾馆。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以，请上车。很高兴为您服务。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能在二十分钟内到那里吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "到旅馆要半小时。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我赶时间，请走近路吧，我有个朋友在等我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以，我保证二十分钟内到。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我昨天在迈克家玩了电子游戏。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "它是怎样的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真是太棒了。英雄，超级战士，都很勇敢，可以打败任何遇到的敌人，可以穿过隧道，在水下游泳，爬过桥。真令人兴奋！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "然后呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我昨天向迈克借了。你要试试吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得很累。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真的建议你早上去跑步。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？那样我之后一整天都会很累。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "恰恰相反！早上跑步能让你神清气爽，准备好迎接新的一天。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你确定？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然，我经常觉得下班后像有一百万美元的收入，可以承担任何事情。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我试试。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "洗衣机又坏了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这不是我的错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真的很想买这台电视机。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太棒了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你卖多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这台电视机2500美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你开玩笑吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这就是它的价格。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对我来说太贵了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这台电视机质量很好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "能降点价吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想出多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "2000美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，2500已经是最低价了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，你在读什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一本旧书《尼罗河上的惨案》，你读过吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有，但我看过那部电影。你看完后能借给我吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然可以。但等我读完你的要点耐心。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你开始打扫你的房间了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我还没有开始，但我会的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你打算什么时候清理？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我打算晚一点把它清理干净。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我告诉过你要早点清理。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道。我确实是打算要清理干净的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一定要用吸尘器打扫房间。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不会忘记的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我希望你清理干净再走。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "你要去哪里旅行？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我认为Hebes是个好地方。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但是我听说中国北方正在经历严重的沙尘暴！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真正的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，据说Hebes经历了六级大风。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这些沙尘暴对生活在这些地区的人们有何影响？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "报告说，沙尘暴过后，呼吸道感染的人数呈上升趋势。沙子进入人们的鼻子和喉咙，造成刺激。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来沙尘暴对每个人来说都是麻烦！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说得很对。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，我想参观西安的兵马俑。请问下什么时候到那个站？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，你坐错车了。你要做151路公汽，方向正好相反。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，天！那我现在该怎么办？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别担心。你可以在下一站下车，穿过街道，到对面去坐151路公共汽车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，我要坐几站？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大约15站。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还挺长一段距离的。你能帮我真是太好了。谢谢你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的荣幸。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有什么事吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没什么。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是我的第一位中国客人。我希望你喜欢西餐。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我非常喜欢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "做饭是我的爱好。我一直在想新的食谱。希望你喜欢这汤。这是我的拿手菜，希望你喜欢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太棒了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "当然。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你们用餐愉快吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我们很喜欢餐品。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可以请你们吃点甜点吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以的，这个主意听起来不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我们的特色菜有巧克力慕斯蛋糕、自制的鲜草莓酥饼，还有辣口的朗姆酒苹果酥。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "苹果酥听起来不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你们是四个人的话，要不要再分一份甜点？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这个建议号。您能给我们一个巧克力慕斯蛋糕和四个甜点叉吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您的甜点是配咖啡还是茶？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给我们四杯咖啡吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，我马上回来给你们拿甜点和饮料。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢。我们在这里用餐很愉快。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "新年到了，我决定重新做人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的？你终于决定把这件事一笔勾销了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你懂我！我有了一份新工作，我住在一个新的城市，有了新朋友！我有机会改变生活方式。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那你打算怎么办？去上艺术课什么的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，首先，我决定戒烟。不是我在省吃俭用什么的，只是我从16岁起就开始抽烟了，我想是时候戒烟了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我赞同。你还打算做什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "最后一件事，我决定出柜了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是时候了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "所以点击这里，然后到顶部。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "呃", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "知道了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "然后打开窗口。对，那个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "就这样，结束了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我都懂了，毕竟很简单。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "艾莉森，你想再来点吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用了，谢谢。我吃饱了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "其实你都没吃多少。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "说实话，我正在节食。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来很可笑。为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这几天我变胖了，我主要注意卡路里摄入。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可以为您点菜了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们还没决定好，能再等会吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，请慢慢来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们能来点喝的吗？我们想要两瓶啤酒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天的特色菜是什么呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天的特色菜是牛排。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我们晚餐吃牛排吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您的牛排要配什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "豌豆和胡萝卜。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。您想要什么甜点？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "冰淇淋，谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "先生，我能为您效劳吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯嗯，我想买台录像机。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们这里有很多型号可供选择。您喜欢什么牌子？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有，我只希望质量很好，是最好的。因为这是给我儿子的毕业礼物。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道了。你儿子现在有录像机吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他用家里的录像机，但他秋天就要上大学了，所以他需要一台属于自己的录像机。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他经常看电影吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，的确。其实他想成为一名电影制片人。他想在大学里学电影。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我有个提议。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果您儿子想学电影，他可能会自己收集电影。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我知道。所以我想让他有一台好的录像机。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不如买一台 DVD 给他？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "DVD？是不是像CD一样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很相似。技术是一样的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那为什么DVD比VCR好？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "首先，先生，影像的品质会比较好。因为它是数字化的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但会更贵吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是有点贵，但是有一个优点您儿子会喜欢的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果您儿子买录像带，是无法保存很久的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "录像带十五年后就坏了。所以如果他收集了很多录像带，十五年后都没用了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "呃", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是真的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是真的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好。那DVD呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这就是dvd的优点。如果你儿子收集dvd，它们会永远保存下去，永远不会变质。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "呃", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他可能会喜欢这一点。我知道他到学校后就要开始收集电影，尤其是如果他攻读电影", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我给你你介绍一些我们的 DVD 放影机。我认为 DVD 会流行起来的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，我看看你们有什么。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你买到公交卡了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我还没买呢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你怎么还没买？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道在哪儿买。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在哪啊？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "学校的的商务办公室有卖的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道呢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你肯定不知道。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我今天晚点再买。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以考虑一下这辆车。性能不错，价格合理。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可不是三岁小孩。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿，怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系。我只是觉得有点头晕。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你确定这和睡眠无关吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我刚刚中了彩票。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在开玩笑吧！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "早上好。这里可以办借书证吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以，我们这里有一个简短的表格；填完了就交给我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "填完了", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，但我还需要你的驾照或其他证件。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然，给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，好的。你知道怎么用吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很清楚怎么用，但你能提醒我一下吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然，只要记住所有需要的信息都在卡片上。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我懂了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，祝你在图书馆阅读愉快！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们看哪部电影？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "现在没有什么好电影。让我们做点别的。你想去听音乐会吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很想去。这有一个不错的音乐会，莫扎特和贝多芬。地点在音乐节大厅。我们去那里好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的！你现在想吃点什么吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，我不饿。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，我们去喝点什么吧。我知道一个好地方。有点贵，但喝的不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这里是售票厅吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想订两张今《简爱》的票。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请稍等。哦，对不起，今晚的票都卖完了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真可惜！明天晚上呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，你真幸运，只剩下两张票了。你想要吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了，我要了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，请告诉我您的姓名和电话号码。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "王敏。电话号码是13811658。我能今天下午来拿票吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，当然可以。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请把帐单拿来好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，当然。我马上回来。给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢。我看一下。我认为账单上有个错误。你介意检查一下吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然不介意。让我查一下。哦，你好像是对的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "税务服务费怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "帐单上只包括百分之十的税。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那么100美元就够了，不是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "确实是这样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "打扰一下。我迷路了。您可以告诉我学者电影院在哪里吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "学者电影院？我想一下。哦。。。想起来了，我知道它在哪里。它在林肯广场。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "离这儿近吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，是的。就堵几分钟而已。红绿灯处左转，你就能看见了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，简，你看起来很棒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你也是。你瘦了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对，我瘦了4公斤。你能看出来我很开心。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我希望你不是疯狂的节食减肥。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，不，我只是改变了我的饮食习惯。保持膳食平衡。我吃的比以前少了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这样对你有好处，坚持下去。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "亲爱的，我有消息告诉你。鲍比和他的妻子伊芙琳很快就要生孩子了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的吗？我以为他妻子不能生孩子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "其实他们在等我生日的时候生孩子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，太巧了！我打赌鲍比一定很高兴。他喜欢孩子，总是想要自己的孩子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "其实，他们对即将出生的孩子都感到很兴奋。伊芙琳想着他们的孩子会是什么样子，因为他们一个是美国人，另一个是中国人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，对了。现在我知道他们为什么想见我们的孩子了。很难想象有什么奇迹！是男孩还是女孩？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还不知道。因为伊芙琳怀孕才三个月。但她已经开始休产假了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦！你是说她现在不用工作了？年轻的父母都有点太夸张，不是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你听说安莱森大卫的事了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有，他们又吵架了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，他们订婚了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你一定在开玩笑。他们两个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，亲爱的。我也不相信。但的确是可靠的消息。大卫今天早上打电话给我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么时候的事？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "上周末，就是他们去锡克旅行的时候。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我现在相信了，他们什么时候结婚？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "明年六月。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我简直不敢相信。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "亲爱的，快点！我们要迟到了！老实说，你准备的时间比我长！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我在晾头发和熨衬衫！你能过来一下吗？我需要你的帮助。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "怎么回事？为什么这些衣服都在床上？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道该穿什么！给我你的意见。你喜欢这个样子吗？条纹短袖衬衫，这件毛线衫和我的幸运凉鞋。我喜欢这条短裤的剪裁和底边，所以我想我也会穿这条的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在开玩笑吗？我该拿你怎么办？我们要去一个晚宴而不是去海滩！穿这件衬衫配我给你买的丝质领带和这条灯芯绒裤子。外面很冷，所以你可以穿这件外套。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢亲爱的！你很有时尚感。现在，我的头发该怎么办呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我怎么办？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我上网时系统崩溃了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你上过非法网站吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有，但这有关系吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯嗯，如果你上了，电脑容易被病毒感染。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道了，我还是别上了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这才低。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的电脑怎么了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "稍等一分钟。哦，是被病毒感染了，而且你没有防病毒软件。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "电脑需要防病毒软件吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。你最好还是了解一下。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "恐怕确实该了解了。但我储存在电脑里的数据呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别担心，应该是自动备份的。我带了一个杀毒软件。要现在安装吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，谢谢。我会非常感激的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她没有朋友吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果她有，她们一定是酒肉朋友。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这样的朋友比敌人还坏。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她最好离他们远点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你退休后通常怎么打发时间？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我几乎都起得很早。我不喜欢睡懒觉。夏天的白天比冬天长，所以我在夏天起得早。起床后锻炼锻炼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你早餐吃什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我一般吃谷类食品，但有时我会做传统的英式早餐。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来不错。你早晨干嘛呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我早上一般会做家务。偶尔去购物。我喜欢一次性把东西买完。我总是开车去市中心的大超市。开车到那里大约需要20分钟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你下午怎么过？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我通常会遇到一些朋友，我们一起运动，或者我可能会花一些时间在我的爱好上。冬天晚上我看电视，夏天晚上如果有时间我就去参加文化活动。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，我是杰克。我是唱诗班的新人。你叫什么名字？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好，我叫托妮娅。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你唱中音吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "事实上，我能同时唱女高音和女中音，但导演让我在下一次表演中唱中音。你呢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "看来我们有调动。我是男中音。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们的低音部分非常好。你会喜欢和他们一起唱歌的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我听到他们早些时候在热身。你说得对。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有你加入真好。我们需要一个好的男中音！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你今晚愿意和我一起出去玩吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，我去不了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那明晚呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想去。但恐怕不行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想去看话剧吗。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的给我打个电话怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不。我最好不打。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "因为我觉得我丈夫不喜欢。谢谢你邀请我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你认为孩子们看电视太久了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我只允许我孩子每天最多看一个小时。我不认为看电视对孩子们有害。孩子们积极点儿，别成天看电视就行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许我应该限制我的孩子看电视的时间。他们在空闲时间不做其他事情。至少他们总是先做作业。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果你打算限制他们看电视的时间，记得给他们做点别的事情。不然他们就会厌烦，然后闹腾。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们可以出去和朋友玩。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。可以和邻居的其他父母谈谈，计划一下，这样孩子们都可以一起玩儿。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许我可以让我丈夫教他们踢足球什么的。他也看太多电视了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好主意。记住，如果父母看太多电视，孩子们可能也会照做。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他小事聪明大事糊涂。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么这么说？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他高估世界的渣滓，却可耻地低估天上的事。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许我们都一样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天有一场精彩的歌剧。我想看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不喜欢情节复杂的戏。今天演什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "\"音乐之声\"。这种音乐大家都知道，适合所有年龄的人。它是关于一个幸福的家庭，不涉及性，暴力，脏话。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道。我看过这部片名相同的电影。安德鲁斯的表演让人终生难忘，从玛丽亚到一位开朗的家庭教师。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，你说得对。我喜欢电影里的那首歌，雪绒花，你还记得吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然，很好听的歌，可以让观众感到平静和愉快。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那些年轻演员演得很好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我希望歌剧比电影更精彩。你买票了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没，我想问你想不想看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "走吧。我们最好早点买票，在饭店吃晚饭。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "猜猜我给你带来了什么。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，一束花。你真好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "希望你喜欢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢花，你知道的。非常感谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，王先生。你想和我一起划船吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来不错，我有段时间没划船了，什么时候？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "明天下午怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以。在哪见？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在公园门口。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好啦。我期待着见到你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "到时见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "再见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，很高兴收到你的来信，你的飞机什么时候起飞？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "20分钟后。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能到机场接我吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么不开心？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我厌倦了工作。我再也受不了公司里的政治指责了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你刚拿到你的评价了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊，但这不是我难过的原因。我刚发现有人升职了。他什么都不会。就知道整拍领导马屁。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太过分了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很生气的是领导竟然看不穿他的花言巧语。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "往好的方面看。至少你还有工作。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊。我不应该再说这个。我也无能为力。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "确实。不如我们今晚喝点东西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "来一瓶冰啤酒怎么样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "日语很容易学。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你搞错了。其实很难。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不觉得。有那么多熟悉的汉字，听起来就像汉语。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说得很对。但是很多日语学习者一开始脸上带着微笑，最后眼里含着泪水。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "留神！你的茶水溢出来了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，请你把火关了好吗？我手上都是面粉。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "就这样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "差不多了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你怎么会只吃这个？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "水果和蔬菜很健康，你知道吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那鸡肉呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我吃烤鸡肉是因为这种吃法很健康。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来既美味又营养。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以试试，不会失望的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "纽约阴天，我真想去佛罗里达旅行，躺在佛罗里达的海滩上享受阳光。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是个好主意。正是佛罗里达旅游的最佳季节。你也可以在那里晒个太阳浴。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但是如果阳光太强，可能会伤害眼睛和皮肤。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以戴上墨镜。记住不要让你的皮肤晒得像西红柿一样红。否则你的皮肤就会开始掉皮。甚至可能得皮肤癌。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我懂了。做得过火弊大于利。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说的对。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿，特德。这个星期五你打算干什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我有一天假。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "嗯，我最近工作很努力，所以我可能会放去轻松。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我可能会呆在家里放松一下。也许看几部电影。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我能去拜访你吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。随时都可以。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "跟我说说你的情人节吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，在那一天，男孩通常送玫瑰给心爱的女孩，女孩送巧克力作为回报。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太浪漫了。年轻人一定很开心。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊，这就是节日的目的，不是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，爸爸。是我，特洛伊。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "你还好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很好。家里一切都好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。家里一切都好。别担心家里面。专心享受你的旅程吧。你那边天气怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这里的天气很好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那太好了，照顾好自己。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我会的。谢谢爸爸。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我爱你，特洛伊。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也爱你，爸爸。再见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "史蒂文，自从汉森回伦敦后，你见过他吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有，但我们仍保持联系。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你保持联系的方式是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们通过电子邮件联系。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "电子邮件并不总是最好的形式。我觉得QQ更好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的话听起来有点道理。但别忘了时差。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说得对。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，我最好回去工作。我有一大堆事情要做！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也是。下班后见，怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "行，一定。我还想搭你的车呢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没问题。五点见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道如何调整我的生活。你能给我一个建议吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你看起来有点苍白，是不是？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我每晚都睡不好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你应该有充足的睡眠。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喝了很多酒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果我是你，我就不会喝太多。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我经常感到很累。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你最好每天早上做些运动。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我有时会发现死亡的阴影在我面前。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你为什么担心你的未来？你很年轻，你会为世界做出巨大贡献的。我希望你接受我的建议。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能来和我们一起过周末吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，恐怕不行。我已经有约会了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太糟糕了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那改天吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是在工作还是在上学？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我还是学生。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在哪上学？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "清华大学。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你真体贴，邀请我参加你的婚礼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我怎么能忘记我的老朋友？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "向你和新娘致以最美好的祝愿！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "下学期我需要一张停车许可证。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是白天还是只在晚上上学？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我只在晚上上夜校。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你开摩托车还是汽车？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "两种车都有，但我通常开汽车去上学。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了，许可证的价格是三十美元；现金、支票还是信用卡支付？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我付现金。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你要不要再复印一张汽车的许可证？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，这是您的许可证；祝你下学期愉快。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你一般什么时候睡觉？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我十点睡觉，六点起床。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这对你健康挺好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我昨天撞到一扇玻璃门。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太蠢了！下次小心点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你有什么想法？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我男朋友。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "再又这样！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你真是个扫兴的人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好，凯瑟琳。你明天想出去吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "明天？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊，我在想我们可以吃点东西看电影。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。如果你愿意，我们可以也做点别的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "晚餐加电影就很完美了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好。我什么时候来接你？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "七点钟怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很好。到时候见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的再见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "再见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你听说迈克尔的新家了吗？在这个地区最高档的一个小区。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他住在基林顿的新住宅区吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，他住在沃顿的一所老房子里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是说老石板路健康中心附近的那个房子吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他的房子肯定值几百万！那是牛津最美丽的地区之一。周边地区非常安静，从那里去市中心非常方便。他怎么买得起那个地方？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他不是买的。他祖父最近去世了，留给他一大笔钱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他知道他祖父很有钱吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "家里没人指望从他那里得到一毛钱。真是个惊喜。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真是个幸运的人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不过，他还是有怨言。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他想住在公交线上，但他没有。所以，如果他想乘公共汽车出行，他必须步行1/4英里才能到公共汽车站。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可怜的家伙。他一定很难。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "完全同意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我正在考虑申请哪所学校？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在考虑公立学校还是私立学校？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不确定。他们之间有什么区别？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "公立学校通常由国家资助，而私立学校通常从别处获得资金。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哪个更好？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "未必有哪一个更好。这在很大程度上取决于学校管理和教师。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我听说你在私立学校必须穿校服。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，有时必须要穿。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今晚你能帮我照看孩子吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很乐意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你最喜欢的书是什么", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "飘", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢它的角色和情节。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯。我最喜欢荆棘鸟", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这本书有趣吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有趣。我也喜欢作者的语言", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果有机会，我会读读这本书的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你愿意和我一起去书店吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好主意。我们走！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "汽车服务中心。需要帮忙吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的车无法起动！破车一辆！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "等下，您在踢车之前，让我们一起先检查一下。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，首先，您能转动点火开关的钥匙吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以！我和我的朋友在一起，他认为火花塞或起动电机可能坏了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有可能出了这样的问题，不过您告诉我，转动钥匙时，您能听到起动电机转动的声音吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "能听到，和我平时起动时听到的声音一样，只有这样。发动机无法起动。或许我该踩油门吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不行。如果您踩油门，会使化油器进水，您的车就永远无法起动了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那怎么办？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "问个可能有点蠢的问题，您的车有油吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯。有的！很好！我的车起动起来了！谢谢！我和您说过要把油箱加满！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我累坏了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，我们回家吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我觉得我的车出故障了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想倒车的时候，发现车坏了，但是找不到哪里坏了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想一下。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "严重吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不严重，小毛病。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么时候可以来取车？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "下午四点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。 谢谢你！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "现在是高峰时间。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我注意到几个街区外有堵车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们开车离开这条路吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "恐怕我要迟到了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有什么观光的好地方？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也不知道。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你听说汤姆和他妻子离婚了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没听说。但我可以猜到原因。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是吗？说吧！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "汤姆是个好人，但赌博成性。他把所有的时间都花在了赌博上。他的妻子无法忍受，所以和他离婚了。是这样吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，很对。赌博毁了一个幸福的家庭。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊！赌博就是一种诅咒。赌博使我们失去了时间和财富，这是一个人最宝贵的两样东西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "而且，许多人赌博，越赌越难以自拔，最后毁了自己。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "总之，赌博是一种恶习。我们应该远离它。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们正在组一个学习小组，准备期末考试。你想加入我们吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但这学期才刚刚开始？为什么这么着急？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你试一次之后，我觉得你在学生上就再也不会有拖延症了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你们多久碰面一次？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们计划每周聚一次。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那一天，你知道吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们在图书馆讨论的是星期三晚上，七点到八点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，算我一个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你敢不敢和那个女孩说话。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "敢，我可以。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很高兴你终于回来了。我想知道发生了什么事。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得我好傻。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们回来时迷路了，我对这个城镇还不太熟悉。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你迷路了。你开玩笑吧！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有。我们在某个地方转错方向。约瑟夫对这个城镇一点儿都不熟悉，所以我开始指路。但是我实在不知道我们在哪儿，所以当真就迷路了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以打电话啊。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道，但是最后我们终于问到人了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "你猜我们到哪里了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道。哪里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当我们终于决定问人时，他们说我们在农场村。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "农场村！你们到了农场村?那是完全不同的城镇！你们怎么会开到完全不同的城镇?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不知道。我们问的那个人要我们走高速公路回到这里来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "农场村离这里有十几英里远。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道。我不晓得这是怎么发生的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，也许我知道。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许我知道事情是怎么发生的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "怎么知道的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你忙着看约瑟夫，却没注意到路。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，你就是这么想的，嗯？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我听说凯文离婚了。这是真的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有那么糟，但他和妻子之间确实存在矛盾。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他的妻子总是抱怨凯文的工资太低，而且得不到晋升。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可怜的凯文，我们应该为他做点什么。他是个不错的人，工作也做得很好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我同意你的看法。但你知道，这是家常便饭。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我刚听说你赢得了长跑比赛。恭喜你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "所以你付出巨大的努力真的值得。希望你能保持今天的记录。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我会尽力的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我认为老师没有权利这么说。老师在全班同学面前指责她。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在开玩笑吧！老师有权说任何想说的话，她看到迈拉作弊，她当然有权这么说。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我同意她有说的权利，但我觉得她应该私下说。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说得对。如果我是老师，我就不会那样做。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得饿了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我要两份超值餐。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "吃饭时喝点什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一杯可口可乐，一杯雪碧，谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "多加三美元，可以换成大份套餐", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，那换吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "要甜点吗，苹果派或者冰淇淋？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我在纽约参加婚礼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们到了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还没有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还有多远？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还很远。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还有多少英里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们快到了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们很快就到吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们到了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "旅馆在哪里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "就在你面前。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我看到了。坐你车真愉快。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很高兴听到您这样说。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，比尔。你要去参加毕业典礼吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。你想和我一起去吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的（几分钟后）。我们去学校礼堂吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "现在坐这个位子。你看到舞台上桌子上那堆红色的文凭了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。我发现我的心像波浪一样起伏，各种各样的感觉涌上心头。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那是真的。四年的风雨，人生的悲欢离合，都涌上心头。当我即将离开校园，开始我人生的新阶段时，我几乎分不清我是高兴还是沮丧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "时光飞逝。看，学院院长已经上台了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他要做开幕演讲。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我说今天天气不错。不如散散步？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我觉得有点累。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "加油！多动动，更健康。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那你能等几分钟吗？我想写完这封信。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别让我等太久。天气这么好，浪费了可就太可惜了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我一会儿就回来。不超过十分钟。你先走吧，我在公园等你行吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧。到湖边找我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这个", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很好。豆子已经磨碎了。现在是第三步。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这么快？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "趁豆子刚磨碎很新鲜的时候冲泡，然后赶紧喝掉，这样味道是最好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，那就快点！这是我的杯子。等不及第四步了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有第四步", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "第四步就是，喝掉咖啡！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "能给我介绍一些美白产品吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "抱歉夫人，其实坦率地说，你不需要美白产品，因为你看起来已经很白了。但你脸上有些雀斑。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那什么样的产品可以淡化雀斑呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我推荐Nisei产品。这个牌子的面霜对祛斑很有效。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "419元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对我来说太贵了。有便宜点的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "恐怕没有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请问一下，我怎么去紫禁城？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "沿着这条路走，在第二个十字路口右转。就到了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "远吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，步行大概只需要15分钟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你有一封信", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给我看看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "它是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是加州大学洛杉矶分校给我的录取通知书。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "写的是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我被录取了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是认真的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真为你高兴！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "纽约大学是我的首选，但加州大学洛杉矶分校也很好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真为你骄傲。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢。我也为自己感到骄傲。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "需要帮忙吗", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想买一件皮夹克。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请问多大号的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "40码。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你喜欢什么颜色？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想一下。你觉得棕色的可以吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，棕色的确实很漂亮，但我认为黑色的更适合你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的吗？那请帮我拿一件。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您还需要别的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这件衣服是真丝的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的。这件衣服很棒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "它可以洗吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以。但必须小心。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请问多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "只要350元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧。你能帮我包一下吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你看起来不喜欢这种锻炼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我一点也不喜欢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你不喜欢这种运动吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不感兴趣。你喜欢吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，很有趣。我以为你喜欢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我讨厌它。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不要介意。十分钟后就结束了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是我尝试过的最糟糕的事情。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你昨晚看的哪个频道？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "24台。它是有线频道，没有广告插入。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是吗？你觉得时装秀怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常好。我一直看到结束。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我决定自己种花园！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么？你对园艺一窍不通！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "正相反，我读了很多这方面的书。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是吗？那你告诉我，聪明鬼，你打算怎么把花园建好呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，首先我需要买一些东西，比如肥料、种子和工具。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么样的工具？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道的啊，最基本的。耙子、铲子、铁锹和锄头。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧。看来你的基础还不错。下一步是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我要耕土，然后播种。再加些肥料，好啦！园艺全部完成！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，祝你的花园好运，特别是考虑到我们正处于旱季，而且未来三个月都不会下雨！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "去哪，夫人？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "去中央车站。我想赶上6点的火车", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果不堵车，没问题的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "中央车站到了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你。车费是多少？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "计价器显示9", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "15美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给你。不用找了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想过升级系统吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "想过，但我不知道自己到底需要什么。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以添加一个绘画软件。方便你制作广告传单和横幅。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那肯定很有用。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可能还想升级硬件，因为之前的硬件已经过时了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "要怎么做？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "首先，你可能需要一个更快的处理器。你还需要一个更强大的硬盘，更多的内存和更快的调制解调器。有光驱吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那你可能还要添加一个光驱，因为大多数新软件都要通过CD安装。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来不错。谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "约翰，我父亲根本不在那儿。你在开玩笑吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可怜的家伙，今天几号，伙计？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是。。。哦，今天是四月一日，愚人节。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你都忘了，是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好。我想买一些名片。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。你想要多少？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "两千张就可以了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请你填一下这张表。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "名片上和表格里的信息一样就行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没问题，先生。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我写好了。给你表格和我的旧名片。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，先生。您的订单一周后就可以准备好了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你认为你能在三天内完成吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没问题，先生。但要多收费。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "飞往罗马的BE407航班延误了。乘客请在休息室等候。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，真烦人！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "出发时间将尽快公布。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这真让人恼火。我必须在五点以前到罗马。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得我穿这件裙子看起来时尚吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得是。蓝色目前仍然很流行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不过，这是去年的款式。我喜欢这条裙子，但我不确定去年流行的今年是否还流行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得这种衣服还会流行几年。时尚不是每年都变的。要不那也太烧钱了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。只有顶级设计师每年都告诉大家去追逐时尚，但只有有钱人才能做到。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有些人是真正的时尚受害者，为了赶潮流花大价钱买衣服。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我希望自己也能成为这些人中的一员，但我根本没有那么多钱。我得控制买衣服的钱，否则我会疯狂购物。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道你的意思。如果我们和男朋友结婚生子，情况会更糟。我们买时髦衣服的钱就更少了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我今晚要去酒吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别喝醉了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在\"金杰家\"的家庭聚会过得怎么样？我听说他们的菜和自助餐都很好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，太棒了。我们有海鲜自助餐。每周五做一次。服务员都很好。他们很细心，不会围着桌子转。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢他们的自助餐，但如果可以点菜更好，因为我不觉得特别饿。我也喜欢那里的酒单。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我也是。他们有世界各地的葡萄酒。每个袋子里的价格都很合理。我们点了一些澳大利亚红酒，味道很好，也不贵。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有些餐馆允许你自己拿酒，只收取瓶塞费，但在\"生姜店\"是不会这样做的。海鲜自助餐包括什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们几乎吃了所有海鲜。有牡蛎、虾、对虾、螃蟹和鱼。我吃了很多熏鲑鱼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有龙虾吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有。你可以从菜单上点。我觉得是龙虾太贵了，不能包括在自助餐里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，可能是。我不喜欢在餐馆点牡蛎。你永远不知道它们是否新鲜。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道。我一点也没吃，但我们组有几个人吃了，没有人生病。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在外面吃饭时，你一般会吃自助餐的东西吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一般不会。我一般只点一道主菜，如果吃完还饿的话就吃甜点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，你一般不点开胃菜？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不点，如果冬天天气冷的话，我可能要一碗汤。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你准备好离开了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "等一下。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请问我能见见经理吗？我要投诉。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，我是这里的经理。夫人，请问您有什么事吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们搬进来之前你们检查过房间了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您在哪个房间？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "1808。厕所坏了，淋浴间也不出水。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听到这个消息我感到非常抱歉。我马上就来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天报纸上有什么有趣的新闻吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有一些关于自然灾害的故事。澳大利亚发生了一场大规模的森林火灾。它覆盖了几平方公里的土地，破坏了更大范围地区。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是意外还是自然造成的？有时天气太热，澳大利亚和非洲会自发起火。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "目前没有人知道，但最近那里很热。非洲的干旱正在造成饥荒。数以百万计的人为了寻找食物而移民。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "国际社会正在做些什么来帮助他们？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "欧盟已经向几家工厂运送了救援物资。一些国家已经派出士兵分发食品和医疗用品。整个地区都建立了难民营。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有多少国家受到影响？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "6个国家受到严重影响，但难民也在向周边几个国家迁移。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我昨天在电视上看到伊朗又发生了一次地震。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。最近那里发生了几次。他们说这次不是大地震。伊朗人自己在处理这件事。他们购买了一些特殊设备来寻找被埋在废墟中的人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "报纸上有关于伤亡的报道吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "到目前为止，死亡人数不到20人，但仍有100多人住院。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿，马克。你在干什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "看电视呢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有什么好看的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "并没有。只是看娱乐体育节目电视网的体育节目。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "所以我想你也很无聊吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "只是消磨时间，直到找到事情做。你打算做什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天是星期六，我们坐在家里无所事事。我们怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想打篮球吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我已经试着联系一些人，但他们都很忙。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你女朋友呢？我以为你今天要和她出去。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她和朋友出去购物了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们去星巴克，然后想些事情做。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。你有烟吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我只剩下几支了。你为什么不在路上买一些呢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的30分钟后见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。再见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "圣诞快乐！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "啊？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我说圣诞快乐！你不知道圣诞节快到了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的？哦，太好了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "啊？你不知道吗？你不兴奋吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "实际上，我都忘了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "忘了？你怎么能忘？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "因为我不是基督徒，我是犹太人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，对不起。我不知道。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没事的。美国有那么多基督徒，每个人都理所当然地认为我是基督徒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是这样的。那么每年这个时候你都做些什么呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，不久后我就要庆祝光明节了，但这对我们来说并不像圣诞节对你们一样那么重要。我一般都是好好享受假期。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果我邀请你去我家参加圣诞晚会，你会非常生气吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一点也不。派对就是派对。我很乐意来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "先生，您现在可以点菜了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您要开胃菜吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "哦，我的车出毛病了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的车太旧了，为什么不买辆新的呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想买辆新的。我最喜欢本田车，尤其是那辆红色的。但是太贵了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，明天下午有一个汽车展览会。我有两张票，你想和我一块去吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好啊。也许我能找到除了本田更喜欢的车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "下午好，先生。你真是这里的常客。请问你为什么经常来这里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我是一名报纸专栏作家。我以写评论为生。我喜欢在咖啡馆工作。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我懂了。但这里不会有点太吵了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不介意。相比之下，我很喜欢这里的环境，因为我在这里可以看到各种各样的人，他们总能给我巨大的灵感。最重要的是咖啡，因为咖啡就是我的生活。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我看得出来。那你最喜欢什么咖啡？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "爱尔兰咖啡是我的最爱。但是我也可以喝其他的。我对咖啡不挑剔。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧。你在家的时候会自己煮咖啡吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不经常。煮咖啡有点麻烦。大多数时候，我只是在星巴克点外卖。而且，我很喜欢速溶咖啡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得速溶咖啡越来越流行了。虽然味道不太好，但确实便宜又方便。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "确实。雀巢咖啡是世界上最受欢迎的咖啡。全世界的人都喜欢它？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "世界上哪个国家的咖啡最好？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "许多人认为巴西出产的咖啡最好。巴西出口大量咖啡。但我喜欢爱尔兰咖啡。所以很难说。就看你的品味了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我同意。我听说在西方国家，几乎每个人都喜欢咖啡。是真的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。毫无疑问。对我们来说，咖啡更像是一种生活方式，而不是一种简单的饮料。我听说中国人不常喝咖啡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对，我们不怎么喝，尤其是老年人。但是越来越多的年轻人喜欢喝咖啡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想是的。这可能就是为什么现在中国有这么多很棒的咖啡馆。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那你怎么了？你看起来很可怜。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是我们怎么了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说我们是什么意思。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你总是说你很忙。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你经常回去和父母住，把我们的儿子一个人留在房间里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我。。。我。。。我想念我的父母，他们也想念我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我记得，我接到了很糟糕的电话，而你不闻不问。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是说我哼哼了几句？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "完全不是。也许是我们的婚姻出了问题。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我得把它交给你，你真的做得很好！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很高兴你能这么想！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我认为你应该得到提拔。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，真的吗？谢谢。。。嗯，我想我还有很多东西要学。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么？你的金表丢了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊。我到处都找不到。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很明显是那个黑衣人偷的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我们去找回来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "喂，是凯茜吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，你是艾伦吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我是，你好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我有两张今晚音乐会的票，你愿意和我一起去吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。非常感谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我六点半来接你，好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，再见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "再见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我回来了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你去干嘛了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "去购物。我太累了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你为什么不去网上购物呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么不？我给你推荐一个网站。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，可以卖什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "几乎所有你在超市看到的都有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "多好的一天啊。阳光明媚，天空蔚蓝。真适合去海滩，美黑一下。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好主意。不像你，我只想看海和玩沙子。我不想晒黑，因为我白点更好看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿。在西方国家，肤色黑象征着健康和财富。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "而在大多数亚洲国家，肤色白象征着美丽和优雅。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这就很有意思了。。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我会带上一顶大帽子，在出发前涂上很多防晒霜。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想做什么就做什么。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "（在海滩上）我的包太重了。我们把东西放在树下吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好主意。阴凉处才凉爽。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我等不及要去海里玩了。现在沙滩都烫脚了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "从没听你提过这个朋友。你和这位朋友关系很好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们关系一直很好。她是一个非常好的女孩。但她得罪了老板。我不忍心看到她为了工作四处奔走。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你一定是被她缠住了，否则你就不会费这么大劲。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们很合得来。没什么，没什么。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有人能告诉我在哪里能买到做中国菜的原料吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "肯辛顿大街上有一家超市。我来帮你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你真好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "来，拿一辆手推车。你想买什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想买饺子馅，比如大白菜", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "水果和蔬菜在那边。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "猪肉。肉柜台在哪里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在那边。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我需要一个平底锅。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，你有特别想要的尺寸吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我觉得越大越好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "看看这个。这是我们最大的锅。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，够大了，但对我来说太重了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，这里还有铝制的锅，跟这个差不多大。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，这个很好看，也很轻。但是这个把手是铝制的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "试试这个吧。同样是铝制的锅，但是有隔热的木质把手。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，是的。这个很好看。我就买这个了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很不错的选择。你想怎么付钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "现金。哦，我差点忘了。我也需要一个锅盖。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起。这儿有个配套的锅盖，给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你怎么了？为什么一直在挠？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得痒！我实在受不了了！我感觉我生病了。我觉得头晕无力。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "让我看看。哇！离我远点！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得你得了水痘！你会传染别人！快走！别在呼吸到我身上！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可能只是皮疹或过敏！在我去看医生之前我们不能确定。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "确诊之前你就是个生物危害！我小时候没得过水痘，我听说如果你成年后得水痘，你甚至会死！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说真的吗？你总是喜欢把事情搞大。不管怎么说，我还是先去洗个燕麦片浴止止痒吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你今晚想去海滩吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "想去，我们要去哪个海滩？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想去马里布海滩。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢圣莫尼卡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那里的水看起来很脏。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我只是喜欢圣莫尼卡的码头。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也喜欢码头，因为晚上很美。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "马里布海滩好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很好，我真的更喜欢这。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想去马里布？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果你愿意的话。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然，我们去马里布吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不好意思，你坐的好像是我的座位。你把我的书搬走了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，亲爱的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你肯定知道这里有人吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，呃，我四处看了看，没有其他位置了。我等了一会儿，也没人来。抱歉，坐了你的座位。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "天好像放晴了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是件好事。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真的不认为这种天气会持续下去。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "希望别再冷了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "需要我帮忙吗", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我能借这本书吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请出示借书证。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我要办一个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果你愿意的话，你现在就可以办一个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。现在就办。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "能填一下这张申请表吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我填完了。给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在卡片背面签个名好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "就是这样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "现在我可以借这本书吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你让我搭便车。我很期待这次聚会，但我不想一个人去。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别客气。这是我的荣幸。你到纽黑文后有没有参加过这样一个大型的，坐下来吃饭的聚会？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有，这是我第一次。上星期我去了迪恩·巴克斯代尔家为新教授举办的野餐会。因为我不想迟到还打了车去，但我是第一个到的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "野餐一般开始得很晚。两点开始意味着你两点以后随时可以到。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你告诉我这个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我从商场回来晚了，但我赶时间。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你为什么这么着急？他们说，八点吃晚饭，现在才七点十五分。我不想再成为第一个到的了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别担心。我们不会是第一个到的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的新工作怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很好，谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得你的新老板怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她还不错。有点霸道，但我会习惯的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是喜欢她还是喜欢前老板？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她比前老板强多了。他不贬低人都不会说话。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的新同事怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们都很随和。工作环境很友好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想念你以前的同事吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。我上一份工作干了好几年，所以对他们都很了解。他们就像我的家人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不同部门的人相处得好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。既然我们是团队合作，就必须相互照顾。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你喜欢和不同部门的人一起工作吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，能让我们从不同的角度看待事物。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你喜欢团队合作吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我更喜欢独立工作。我想大多数人都是这样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在这里见到你真是太巧了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是很巧，不是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "鸡肉怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很好吃。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许我们都会成为男人的全部。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太可怕了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但为了生活，我们就会被这个社会改变。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真的不想进入这个世界，我很害怕。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别傻了。我们已经到了自己承担责任的年龄。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想知道莎拉和马特怎么了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你不知道他们已经分手了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不惊讶。简很普通。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他很帅。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "用不着，汤姆今天请客！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "汤姆在哪里？在KTV办单身派对可是他想出来的，对不对？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "要是汤姆做主的话，我们连婚礼都会在KTV办！他真爱唱歌。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我在友谊宾馆，1106房间。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，12点15有人会去接您。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "都安排好了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，太谢谢你了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的，没什么。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "六门必修课，两门选修课。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "进来，进来！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，加里，发生什么事了？我在剧院等你。你为什么不来见我？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我以为我们在这里见面。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你不知道我们的电影七点开始吗？我们原计划五点到七点在剧院见面。在公寓见面没意义啊。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起。我们一定是误会了对方的意思。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你为什么不说清楚点？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说得对。我很抱歉。我们去看电影吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没事的。我现在不想去。我们已经错过了电影的十分钟了。我不想看没有开头的电影。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，乔治，今天天气真好！太阳很大，一片一片的云朵！多么适合去海滩的一天啊！孩子们会玩得很开心的！孩子们去玩，我们可以晒晒太阳放松放松。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "动起来。你能帮我拿伞吗？完美。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，孩子们，这里有一个沙滩球和一个飞盘，一个桶和一把铲子。在我们离开之前，我希望看到一个很棒的沙煲。不要走得太远。等等！把凉鞋留这或者穿上湿的鞋。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "待在浅水区。不要超过那个沙洲！那里的水太深了，我们没带浮标。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你已经回来了？水太冷了，是吗？告诉你个秘密。你看到那边那小水池了吗？那里会暖和些。去看看你能不能找到一些贝壳或者捉到一些小鱼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那是什么？水母？杰里米，马上把它放下！它可能会刺痛你！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "啊！快下去！噢！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说他的祖母已经死了是什么意思？等等，你不觉得他在躲我，是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，你知道的，声称你的祖母病了是用来逃避做某事的典型借口。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "天哪，我讨厌被拒绝。这真的让你感觉很糟糕，尤其是当你真的喜欢那个人的时候。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有什么我能帮忙的吗？你要记住，只要你想说我一直都在。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得孩子们是不是看电视看太久了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我只允许我孩子每天最多看一个小时。我不认为看电视对孩子们有害。孩子们积极点儿，别成天看电视就行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许我该限制我孩子看电视的时间。他们一闲下来啥也不干就看电视。至少他们以前总会先做作业的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果你打算限制他们看电视的时间，记得给他们做点别的事情。不然他们就会厌烦，然后闹腾。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们可以出去和朋友玩。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。可以和邻居的其他父母谈谈，计划一下，这样孩子们都可以一起玩儿。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许我丈夫可以教他们踢足球什么的。他也老爱看电视。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那是个好主意。记住，父母要是总看电视，孩子也会照做的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好。我想咨询下你报纸上刊登的汽车广告。我想知道车还在吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还在。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，麻烦您能告诉我行驶里程和轮胎使用情况吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，这车行驶里程很短，轮胎状况和外形都很好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "爷爷，这家餐馆看起来好老了！它建成多少年了呀？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道什么时候开张的，但我知道它比我老。小时候，我总在这里吃饭。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，真有趣。爸爸也说他小的时候您常带他来这。现在，轮到我了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊，我们是这里的贵宾呢。你今天想吃点什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想要一个汉堡和一瓶可口可乐。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿，孩子，别搞错了，这是一家中餐馆。咱吃点传统的吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我就没什么特别想吃的了。爷爷，你最喜欢吃这里的什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "八宝饭。你爸爸也爱吃，你想尝尝吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然，甜吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是甜的。但我觉得他们也能给你做碗咸的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了，我还要辣的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可别太过了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我就想要点特别的。您知道我爱吃辣的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那好吧。我要他们放些红辣椒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想要定做一条裙子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我能给你量尺寸吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，腰最好紧一点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "要多长时间？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大约一周。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "裁剪的费用多少？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一条裙子20元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能帮我挑一件礼物吗，送给我侄女的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大多数小女孩都喜欢芭比娃娃。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来不错。我看看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是最新款——数码芭比。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，很漂亮。多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "只要29", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "95美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，价格很合理。我就买这个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了。你还要别的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "总共32", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "42美元。是现金付款吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯嗯，现金可以。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是找你的钱。谢谢惠顾。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我现在可以为您上菜了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用了，我习惯先喝茶。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "加糖？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用，谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "马丁，你的购物之旅怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "事实上，这真是我经历过的最有趣的一天。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的吗？你有找到什么便宜货吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有！我找到了这个可爱的茶壶。这是我在商店里看到的最好的东西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你怎么在城里转悠的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "坐出租车。这大概是最容易的方式。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，所以你没有迷路？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我确实迷路了，不过我遇到了一些很友好的人。他们很快就帮我带路了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我工作如此努力，以至于没有精力锻炼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那只是个借口。你总能找到一些时间锻炼身体。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但我总是长时间地努力工作。我常常没有时间吃午饭。然而，我还是越来越胖了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "比尔，你知道工作和锻炼不一样，工作给人压力而不会让人放松。不吃饭也不能帮助你减肥。其实，如果你不吃饭，你的身体只会储存脂肪。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道你是对的，但我能做什么呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不如去散散步，而不是每天晚饭后坐在沙发上看报纸？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但我会错过新闻的。对我的生意来说，及时了解中国的动态是很重要的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道，你有手提收音机吗?你可以一边听新闻一边保持健康。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好主意！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，安，你最近在澳大利亚呆了很长时间，为什么不聊聊那段时光呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真的很喜欢生活在澳大利亚。我是一名国际学生，我在悉尼大学学教育。住在悉尼真是太棒了，因为我可以随时去海滩，而且悉尼的夜生活很棒。有很多很棒的夜店。人们非常友好、随和，我在悉尼遇到了很多其他国家的人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯。你在那儿呆了多久？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我在那里呆了将近一年。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我在澳大利亚旅行过一段时间。我去了东海岸。去了世界遗产弗雷泽岛。我看见野狗在沙滩上奔跑，鲨鱼在水里穿梭。我们爬上悬崖，穿过雨林，去露营，然后我们去了一个偏北的地方。在澳大利亚越往北走，天气就越热。所以我们可以在海里游泳，我第一次去潜水有点冒险，因为我没有潜水执照，所以我去参加了一个基础潜水，我在海里看到一个巨大的蛤蜊，里面有一个真正的紫色海绵，我可以摸到它，然后蛤蜊马上就关上了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那么，你手指被夹住了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "差点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "差点啊，你真幸运。嗯，有意思的是，你在海里其实要担心的是鲨鱼，而不是蛤蜊。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你很快就要回澳大利亚了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想去那里至少住一年。也许我会回悉尼，也许我会去墨尔本，墨尔本是一个非常有趣的文化城市。有很多博物馆和公园。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "昨晚我找了我的印度同学芭芭拉。我发现她盘腿坐着，静静地练习。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用说，肯定是印度瑜伽。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "玛丽，你再多说点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "追溯起来，瑜伽的历史非常久远，它发源于印度有文字可考的历史之前。古代文献已记载了瑜伽，而这些文献又是要根据以前口口相传下来的内容整理编写的。换句话说，瑜伽是从不可追忆的远古时代传下来的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "妈妈，我可以晚点完成作业吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "抱歉。你知道规则的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但我现在想看电视。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那是不可能的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "拜托了", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不可能。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一个小时都不行吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，这是不可能的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她老板跟你说了什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他要我抓紧工作。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这样啊。你最近看起来很不高兴。怎么了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没什么，谢谢关心。我只是最近心情不好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天天气晴朗，是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊。这里的秋天真是太美了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "冬天怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "冬天挺难熬的。空气又冷又潮湿，道路经常结冰。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很无聊吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "夏天雨水多吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很多。我们从不担心我们地区雨水不足。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "所以你经常随身带伞吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，不。看来我们迟到了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们坐在后面吧。我们仍然可以听到牧师的讲话。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这里人太多了。里奇、凯斯和泰勒的父母在哪里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们可能在前面。牧师就要讲话了。让我们听听。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真是感人的演讲。他一定很了解泰勒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我真希望这一切都不会发生！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "汤姆，你答应过把肺切片的。你不会忘记的吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不会的，我保证。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你记得把电视修了，好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你保证？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "汤姆，你还得帮约翰尼做作业，好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我看看吧。如果有时间我就帮他，不一定。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但你今晚晚餐肯定不会迟到，对不对？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。只要你好声好气问我我就不迟到。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "汤姆，亲爱的。今晚你尽量别迟到，好吗？拜托！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，我保证。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好，先生，我能为您效劳吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我不小心把手机掉在马桶里了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我懂了。你来对地方了。我们拥有20多家领先手机制造商的100多种型号。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来不错。我不想太贵，中档的就行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们有一款新的ETC智能手机，它带有Android操作系统，所以你可以下载应用程序。它还有内置摄像头、mp3播放器和触摸屏。它在3G网络上工作，因此无论您身在何处，都可以快速访问互联网。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "Wi-fi呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然！您可以从任何热点访问互联网，也可以从家中访问互联网。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "最后一件事。它防水吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "下次你买蔬菜水果的时候，来之前记得要装袋称重。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "抱歉，我不知道。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "总共是65", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "81美元。您怎么付款？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "用我的ATM卡付款。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "将您的卡滑入识别板，然后再输入密码。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "稍等一下，您想取点现金吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "纸还是塑料？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您需要纸袋还是塑料袋？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我要纸袋谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的车怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一辆拖车拖着我的车，把我的车都压扁了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们会赔偿你的损失吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们说压痕原本就有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么鬼。那没道理。你打算怎么办？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我得上法庭。当时有个警察在场，这样他就能证明损坏之前没发生过。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太糟糕了。如果那发生在我身上，我会很生气的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我估计是四千美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "天哪。该死。。。去他妈的，我会烧了他们的店。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们等着看庭后会发生什么。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "你看！这个女孩很漂亮，她对我微笑。她很可爱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不同意。她很漂亮，但她总是冷热不定。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你为什么这么想？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她是我妹妹，你知道的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "晚上好。欢迎光临我们餐厅。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "晚上好。我们想要一个8人包间。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，先生。现在没有空包间。您想在大堂吃饭吗？我可以给您找一张靠窗的桌子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用了，谢谢。我们以前预订过。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请问你叫什么名字？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我叫詹姆斯。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我让服务员给您带路。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "先生，有什么事吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天早上有什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "果汁，蛋糕和点心，什么都有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想要一杯番茄汁。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有麦片吗，先生？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一盘奶油小麦。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还要鸡蛋？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "培根和鸡蛋加黄油吐司。我喜欢我的培根很脆。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想要什么样的鸡蛋？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请油煎吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还需要其他什么吗，先生？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，够了。谢谢你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好！我是洪磊。你叫什么名字？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好，洪磊。我叫瑞奇。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，瑞奇。你是这里的新生吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，今早上了第一课。你也是新生吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，我已经来了六个月了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "六个月。很长时间了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "其实没那么久。你在哪个班？中级还是？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "中级三班。那你呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我在高级一班。你的老师是谁？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我记不起她的名字了，但她有一头卷曲的红发。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "啊！她戴眼镜吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我想是的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那可能是安妮·沃利斯。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，没错。你认识她吗？她也是你的老师吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不。但她上学期教过我。你来多久了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "只有一个星期。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哇，没多久。你住在哪里？和家人在一起？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我现在住在基督教青年会。我在找一个能住的更久的地方。你知道什么好地方吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。实际上，我朋友公寓里有一间空房，她正在找室友。你要她的电话号码吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那太好了！谢谢你的帮助。可以请你喝咖啡吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿，丹尼尔，最近怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿，爸爸，今天我上了一堂很棒的历史课。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哇，你很少这样，课上讲了什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们已经学了柘河驶向西海的故事。他真是个伟大的航海家。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的老师告诉你他走的路线了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，他带着他的舰队，穿过印度洋，到达了非洲东海岸。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了，你还记得他什么时候开始航行的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然，那是从1405年到1433年，也就是明朝。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很好，顺便问一下，我给你买的《鲁滨逊漂流记》，你看完了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还没有，你知道我作业很多。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你应该加快速度，因为鲁滨逊的故事可以让你更好地理解你今天学到的东西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，好爸爸，晚饭后，我就开始看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好儿子！等等，丹尼尔，《加勒比海盗》什么时候上映？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是那部关于杰克·斯派洛船长在海上找到宝藏的电影吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错，现在，告诉我时间。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不会告诉你的，除非你答应让我和你一起看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "既然我们知道要演奏什么样的音乐，我们就必须决定每个人要做什么。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我喜欢街舞，所以我应该跳舞。你会说唱吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，是的！我是个很棒的说唱歌手。我记得香草冰所有的歌词。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了。我要开始练习我的舞步了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "早上好，约翰。你从图书馆借的狄更斯小说看完了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还没有。我两天前感冒了。我只读完了一半。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听到这个消息我很难过。你现在感觉怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我今天感觉好多了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你打算几天读完它？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大概三四天吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的三天后，我来找你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你最近好像很忙。你在干什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我休了10天假，假期过后有一大堆工作要做。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你去哪里度的假？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "巴黎。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那么，弗雷德，你毕业后打算干什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我在老家已经找了一份工作。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太酷了。你已经找到公寓住了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我打算和父母住在一起。你呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "即使我想也不行。我父母告诉我，如果我回家，我就得自己找地方住。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是说他们要把你赶出去？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不是，他们只是不想我住在家里。我姐姐就是这样，她在家里住了七年。她一开始住在家里，后来就越来越难搬出去了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我父母可不想让我一辈子待在家里。他们说我一开始搬回家没关系，但他们希望我在一年左右后找到一个属于自己的地方。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的父母就是没有很好处理和姐姐的关系，正因为如此，他们希望我更加独立。他们认为我应该学会如何独立生活。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道我需要自己学习，但我现在没有钱。住在家里能让我在找到住所之前攒点钱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那女人又被打了。她为什么不报警。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "因为打她的是她的丈夫。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太不可思议了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她说家丑不可外扬。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你找房子怎么样了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不是很好。还没有找到我心仪价格内的房子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你预算是多少？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我一个月只能负担大约300英镑。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这么看来你只能合租了，租一间卧室。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的吗？这租一间房也太贵了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "想住在伦敦，就得付这么多！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道有谁找室友吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可以问问周围的同事们。你会优先考虑吸烟的还是不吸烟的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我希望合租者不吸烟。不过，我想我总得为得到的付出点代价！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想签多久的合同？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "顶多一年。我不知道一年之后自己会去哪里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "公寓需要带家具吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我什么家具都没有，所以如果家具能一应俱全那就太好了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "除了房租你还得付水电费，你知道吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道，我以为会包括在房租里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一般不包括在，所以你得考虑下每个月要交100英镑的水电费。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想我负担不起。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别担心。如果你答应打扫卫生或照顾孩子，有时会有折扣。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那还不错。我会找找看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "小心，帕特里克！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哟！谢谢，凯伦。那辆车差点撞到我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，兰迪。你现在在做什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没做什么。看电视呢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我有两张新上映电影的票。你想和我一起看吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。几点？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "电影两点开始。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来不错。我们几点在哪见？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在我的停车场，下午2点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧。到时候见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请问，最近的加油站在哪里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "沿着这条街走到红绿灯处。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "去红绿灯那里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对的，在红绿灯处左转。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在灯前离开？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "然后就在桥边。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "就在桥边？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。加油站在左边。你不会错过的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们走吧。这个公寓太小了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我同意。我去看看报纸。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有房子就好了，我可以种一个花园。你可以用车库做车间。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这出租广告还不错。两居室，没有家具，但有带栅栏的院子，一个车库。可以养宠物。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "租金是多少？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "广告上说325美元外加押金。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么时候有空？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "现在就可以，而且位置很好。你就快下班了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你BELTS考得怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好极了！我总分是八分。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太棒了！你收到有条件录取通知书了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。我在等，等我正式被大学有条件录取后再申请签证。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道签证处在哪里吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "就在东四十条地铁站附近。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那不太远。你觉得我能拿到签证吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你以前出国过吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我去过泰国、埃及和日本。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你以前被拒签过吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "从未。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那很好。你打算移民到另一个国家吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，我想毕业后回到中国。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这正是签证官想听到的。你有钱支付学费和食宿费吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我得到了全额奖学金，所以我在学习期间不需要任何其他花销。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我认为你很有可能获得签证。如果你愿意，我可以帮你准备签证面试。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那太好了。准备得越充分越好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你看起来很兴奋。发生什么事了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你听了绝对不敢相信。你还记得我们在梅耶百货看到的那件漂亮又昂贵的衣服吗？我今天半价买的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "所以他们在今年的年终促销提早开始了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你怎么这么冷静？你不去看看有没有适合你的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我再等几天吧。可能还有更大的折扣。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但不会有什么好东西了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想买个平底锅。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您想要什么尺寸的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我做了很多大餐。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得这个怎么样？这是一个16英寸的平底锅。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，尺寸合适，但太重了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，看看我们的铝锅。它轻多了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，这个很轻。但是把手也是铝的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没问题。看看这个。同样的平底锅，但有一个轻巧的木把手。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了。这正是我要找的。我会买的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想你会喜欢这个锅的。你想用现金支付吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。哦，请等一下。盖子呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很抱歉。我忘了给你看。给你。它是和锅一起的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "来，我帮你开门。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你需要帮忙吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "其实，我需要帮忙。非常感谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别担心。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哪个队赢了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "都没赢。比赛以二平告终。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但我仍然认为AC米兰的防守更强。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但巴西人更强硬。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "霍莉，我刚听到一个可怕的消息。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也是。我无意中听到有人说泰勒得了脑瘤。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么？不，我听说他得了胃癌。他的前女友说的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这就是为什么他胃痛。他想瞒着我们。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许这就是他没来参加聚餐的原因。你见过他吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有，但有人说他在男厕所里呕吐。跟上我！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你如何看待吸烟？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "害人害己。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你认为人们怎样才能戒烟？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "停止香烟生产。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但这会影响国民经济。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错。但我不认为有更好的方法。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在烟盒上画个警告图怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许有效果。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好，有什么能帮到您的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯。我在找参加正式聚会的衣服。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你穿什么尺码的衣服？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "中号，女性尺码10或12。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这件衣服是巴黎的最新款式。它是用真丝做的。这件丝绸衬衫和这条裙子相配。你喜欢吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以试穿感觉一下。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好主意。我要试穿一下。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "感觉如何？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "感觉很棒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你看起来真美。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以。我要了。非常感谢你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不客气。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么？你怎么会忘记预定音乐会的票？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很抱歉。我都忘了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你怎么可以忘？我今早提醒过你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我突然想到了。我真的很难过。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我整个月都在期待这场演出。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真的很抱歉让你失望了。我会补偿你的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我在这里过得很愉快。非常感谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "保持联络！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我保证。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你吃完饭了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯嗯，吃完了。麻烦结一下帐。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。你们准备好就可以找我了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你们收支票吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，很抱歉我们不接受。我们接受信用卡和现金。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我身上没带现金，只好用信用卡了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢，我马上回来。需要打包盒吗？我回来后可以给您带一些。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯嗯，谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你需要帮忙吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我需要买一台新冰箱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你看到你喜欢的东西了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "肯莫尔看起来不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是一个很好的选择。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "它很便宜，而且所有的电器都有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么电器？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "冰箱和冰柜非常宽敞，还有制冰机和饮水机。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可以进去看看吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "看看吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常好。我想买这台冰箱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想是时候学习了。化学课快考试了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我知道。什么时候？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "12月1日。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "考试内容是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好像是从第六章到第十章。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好。我觉得我的化学考试及不了格了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你为什么这么悲观？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不是悲观。我是现实。我的化学太差了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我相信你只要做好准备就能通过考试。别灰心。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢。你真好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你为什么不坐下来放松一下，亲爱的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不想。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，那就过来和我谈谈。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然不是。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我可以打开电视吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "打开电视，为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们可以一起坐下来听音乐。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听音乐？那谁来做饭呢？你吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我做，不过我们晚饭后去迪斯科吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "去迪斯科舞厅？哦，不。你知道我讨厌它。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，托尼。好久没见到你了。你最近怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，我找工作已经好几天了，但还没找到工作。最近找工作太难了。你找到了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我找到了一份工作，一份餐馆服务员的工作。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你薪水高吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "额，每小时10美元，但小费我可以留着。每晚大约能赚80美元", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "其实，我们那儿还有一个空缺。如果你感兴趣，你就可以来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太棒了！我现在就去和老板谈谈。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我对那部电影期望太高了，结果我有点失望。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但我听说第一周票房就卖到了1500万。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "如果我是你，我会去美国。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我应该申请哪一所大学？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有许多大学供你选择。一些著名的大学，如哈佛、耶鲁、密歇根大学和麻省理工学院都很好，非常有竞争力，但是学费昂贵。一些规模较小的大学或学院也很不错，但要便宜得多。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我明白了。非常感谢你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这些是你的课本吗？生物化学，普通生态学，植物学，细胞遗传学，分子遗传学。。。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。为了期末考试，我得复习一下。就在拐角处。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，对了！你每学期期末有很多考试吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那要看情况了。有些学期有很多，有些没有。有些课程没有考试，只要求写论文。就很简单。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你什么时候准备期末考试？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "老实说，大多数学生都是在考试前一个月准备的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的？你复习就用一个月？有用吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然，很有用。老师笔记的复印件是非常重要的，因为考试中的大多数问题都是以笔记为基础的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哇，所有的要点都在笔记上吗？你真聪明！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但考试并不像你想象的那么简单。我们得熬夜。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "哦，有的。我喜欢打羽毛球，乒乓球和玩电脑游戏。我最爱的就是玩游戏。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我听说许多青少年会花很长时间玩电脑。他们根本不关心自己的健康。你呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也差不多。他们说整天玩游戏会变笨，但我觉得很刺激。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你玩的不会是那种暴力的网络游戏吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "偶尔。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "6000英里，全是公路里程。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "公路里程是什么意思", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "公路里程没有当地里程那么糟糕。它们对汽车伤害不大。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，为什么里程数这么大？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "车主每天上下班都要穿过州界。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我得考虑一下。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "留下您的电话号码，如果降价的话我会给您打电话的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "需要我帮忙吗", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我想要把这个包裹寄到长春。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "没有，就是一些花瓶。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "是的", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这次可以吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "当然。第七题选B。还有其他问题吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们最好现在就走。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "天气太热了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "完全同意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得当秘书怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我对那种工作一点也不感兴趣。会让我疯的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "算一个。他也以从不放弃自己的目标而闻名。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的。他竞选了好几次才最终当选。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也钦佩他在争取平等权利方面的勇气。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他很有远见，不是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还很谦逊。要是可以，我真想亲眼见见他。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们今晚出去吃饭好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们可以去那家新开的中餐馆。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我没问题。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，我们试试。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧。如果你真的想去，那就去吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这太烦了，我讨厌买内衣。好吧，随便买点赶紧走。嗯嗯，这很不错。哦，不，别过来，别过来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好像迷路了，需要帮忙吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "呃，我只是逛逛。明天是我女朋友的生日。我想给她买点东西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你不能给买她奶奶穿的内裤。你想过给她买睡衣吗？我们有很多可爱的丝质睡衣。或者，这套内裤和胸罩怎么样，很漂亮。看，这款缎面挺胸很漂亮，还可以搭几种不同款式的内裤。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "确实不错。太尴尬了", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我该选什么？她穿多大的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，你想买条丁字裤吗，还是要比基尼内裤？或者这条漂亮的花边男孩短裤？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "随便买点东西然后离开这里。和这两个一起也太丢人了。我只想快点结束这一切。她最好谢谢我", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给您，先生。我相信她会喜欢的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "终于结束了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "是的。他非常爱这个女孩。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他要和谁结婚？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想是他在西班牙度假时遇到的一个女孩。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们定好结婚日期了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还没有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "史蒂文，我们正在为新年晚会准备一场武术表演。你想加入我们吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很想加入！但是我从来没有学过武术，而且距离新年只剩下一个月了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系。一个月就足够你学会基本动作了。我们的节目有了你会很精彩。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来很棒！我要学那些李连杰在电影里的动作吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不是。你知道的，中国功夫有很多门类和派别。我们要表演的是一套中国太极拳。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么都行！我很高兴学点中国功夫。谢谢你的邀请。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "埃莉是谁？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她是我的小侄女。今天是她的生日。他们在唱\"生日快乐\"歌。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我了解了。她多大了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她十岁了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "今天。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，没想到！你多大了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "18岁。我的朋友今晚要为我举办生日派对。你想来吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。什么时候？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大概六点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我大约五点半到你家。生日快乐。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿，简。。。你了解我们公司的保险制度吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯。。。我挺了解的。怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我从来没有真正注意过我们的保单细则。。。但看来我得索赔了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么？你还好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我得了腰椎间盘突出，医生说我最好手术。我们的工人保险可以报销手术费用吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果是因公受伤，肯定可以报销。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯。。。我想我得再和医生谈谈。反正。。。既然我要索赔，我最好试着了解一下这个制度。你可以详细说说吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。我们主要有两种职工保险。。。工人补助金和医疗保险。公司承担工人补助金和大部分医疗费用的保险费，但你也要支付部分保险费。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "就是我每个月在工资单上看到的保险费，对吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的。不同国家有不同的保险制度，但我们这里是从私营保险公司购买保险。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果我在办公室工作时滑倒摔断了胳膊，可以申请工人补助金对吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的。公司会为你支付所有的医疗费用，如果你需要请假看医生或休养，公司还会给你一些经济补偿。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "快点，上车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我进去了，我们走！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，在这里左转。等等，我是说右转。快点，快点！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "天哪！急什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别担心，开车就行了。哦，我的天，要变红灯了。踩一脚油门！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你疯了吗！我不会闯红灯的！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不管了。在这里右转。这个时候高速公路上会特别堵。我们走小路吧。走吧！让开！快走，快走！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你有什么问题！天哪。发脾气可没用！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯嗯，我知道有条捷径", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在这，我们可以穿过阿什伯恩高地。快点，快点！小心那位女士！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我已经尽可能开很快了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太棒了！我们到了。5点58分，赶在图书馆关门前。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你真是个怪人！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我能载你回家吗，沃德太太？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "李先生，你真是太好了。非常感谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我把钥匙拿出来的时候，你能帮我撑伞吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。今晚真糟糕，不是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊，非常可怕。好了，门现在开着。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你带黑墨水了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "墨水应该在文具区回形针和图钉旁边，先生。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我找过了，但没看到黑墨水。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那恐怕没有存货了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，那我要蓝黑的。我还要一打航空信封。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有一打的十个和一打二十个的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我要一打二十个的。鞋带在哪里能找到？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在三号柜台。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢。我在这家商店里总是找不到路。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道。我在这里工作，也是花了三个星期才熟悉。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能给我一些建议吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这件衣服是按你的尺寸做的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "感觉很好。但如果是深色的，我会更喜欢的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，也许你可以试试这个。它是黄色的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哇!这里什么都有，全都是世界名牌。辛迪阿姨，您最喜欢什么牌子?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢所有时尚的东西，但是我最喜欢的牌子是香奈儿。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，香奈儿挺贵的，不过物有所值。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，它的每一款都是由世界顶级设计师特别设计的，所以它们总能让你光彩照人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "原来如此。来这儿，这双高跟鞋看起来真漂亮，但我不知道穿起来舒不舒服。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不怎么舒服，尤其是刚开始的时候。如果你一整天都穿高跟鞋，你的脚会疼的。但是，没什么大不了的。女人总是会习惯的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "美丽真不是一件简单的事。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "确实，但是每个人都喜欢漂漂亮亮的。嘿，你觉得这副太阳镜配这个手提包吗?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "挺配的，很有品味。有了它们，你看起来更时尚了。哦，这里有这么多法国香水师。哦，男士香水?这么奇怪!", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "拜托，时尚不只是女人的专利。男性也有追求时尚的平等权利。男士擦香水是一种新时尚，这种香水叫做古龙香水。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，真的？这可真是个新鲜事，恐怕不是每个人都能接受。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这需要时间，但是人们的消费态度正在迅速改变。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那倒是真的。显然，时髦的成本不菲。那么，你把所有的钱都花在这上面了吗?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "你怎么会是我妈妈的姐妹?你们两个太不一样了。她总是买便宜货，而且入不敷出。你比她做得好多了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不得不说这是我们消费习惯不同的结果。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想买些布做窗帘。哪一个更好？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "斜纹呢？好洗，不会变形。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那件棉布的呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，它很便宜，而且洗的时候颜色很容易褪色。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿，布拉德。你今天怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不错。你要去哪里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我要回家了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "等一下。我们得回到指导教室，不然等着被开除。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是这样吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们的班主任必须再来一次，以确保我们都在这里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "所以他早上和下午各来一次。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊。我要去我的储物柜拿我的夹克。待会儿见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你喜欢什么样的音乐？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我最喜欢流行音乐。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也是", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你最喜欢的歌手是谁？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "打扰一下。我在找Bluemingdails。你能告诉我该怎么去那里吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。实际上很近。你先沿着这条路一直走。然后在下一个路口左转。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在下一个路口左转。好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "Bluemingdails就在那个街区的拐角处。你左转时会看到的。说真的，你不可能会错过的。它很大。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "500美元，女士。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "就这样。很简单。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。这最符合我的口味。我要了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能介绍一下新西兰的农业和工业吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "新西兰的农业高度机械化。该产业主要集中在农牧产品制造业。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "那你应该好好打扮。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得你穿白衬衫配蓝领带很好看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你很聪明。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然，运动鞋不适合正式场合。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说得对。我应该穿什么样的鞋？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "棕色皮鞋和你的裤子很相配。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好主意。哦，顺便问一下，聚会结束后你能来接我吗，亲爱的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "哦，我也喜欢他，不仅歌唱得好，而且比赛中遇到困难时也很坚韧不拔。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，第一次海选他被淘汰了，但他没有放弃。然后他又参加了两次海选。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "他进入前三名之前，我很紧张。怕他被淘汰。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊，比赛里有那么多优秀的选手。谁知道最好谁能胜出呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对啊。所以当他进入决赛时，我非常兴奋。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他在决赛中表现的真的很好，特别是在PK回合。他表现得很好，大多数观众都给他投了票。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "然后主持人宣布，他最终获得了冠军！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我在找平底锅。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没问题。您想要什么尺寸的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一个大的就好了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这个怎么样？这是我们最大的——直径16英寸。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不错。我喜欢那个。但它太重了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，试试这个。它是铝做的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错，这样好多了。但它有一个铝制把手。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这个呢。同样的锅，但有一个最先进的耐热塑料手柄。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，太完美了。我要了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太棒了。是现金还是收费？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，等等。锅盖呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很抱歉。我忘了给你看盖子。它是随锅一起的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，不，不好意思！那是残疾人停车位。你有残疾吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，但这是紧急情况！拜托！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，但是你得把车停在指定的地方。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，好吧，好吧！那你把大门打开！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "耐心点，小姐，就一会儿。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "感谢上帝！一辆车要走了。轮到我了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很明显，他们的政府希望控制其他所有国家。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是他们的惯用手法。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们能做些什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们必须继续发展经济，同其他发展中国家一道同它作斗争。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你通过考试了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，我没有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听到这个消息我很难过。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好，我要叫辆出租车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大约要等16分钟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的把你的地址给我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真的很想改变一下。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在想什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想试试新的款式。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想让我做什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我要你把我的头发剪短。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有多短？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我希望我的头发只有几英寸长。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你真的要那么短吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我想那样剪已经有一段时间了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果你真的想让我剪，那我就剪。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我确信这就是我想要的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们开始吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们的数学老师很幽默。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "相反，我认为他很严肃。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，一点也不。他的例子很有趣。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "所以很容易记住。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，你的数学老师呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他是个老古董，很严肃。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "运气不好，安妮。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿！你的历史老师怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她也是一个老古董。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听到这个消息我很难过。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对了，你能告诉我今天星期几吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天星期四。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "几号。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "5号。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这个周末我打算试试跳伞。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果我是你，我就不会这么做。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来很有趣。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道，这很危险。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想试试刺激的东西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我告诉你，这很容易受伤。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "下周一我再和你慢慢说。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，自己保重，别说我没警告你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好？那是马克吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好吗？我好久没有听到你的消息了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我一直在国外，你最近忙吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很忙。那你这次回来就不走了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我只是想知道你什么时候有时间去钓鱼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我周末不上班，所以我们可以去喝点冰啤酒和拿上钓鱼竿，然后去河边。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来不错。我想念你，我的朋友。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也是。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿，鲍勃。你有来过这里的感觉吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有的，我肯定我以前来过这里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许我们在兜圈子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我们一小时前经过的那个酒吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在担心什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很担心我丈夫。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他在哪？他有危险吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道的，他是个出租车司机。他开车的时候，尤其是在交通高峰期，眼睛一直要睁着。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "李雷，你能告诉我复活节的起源吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "圣经说耶稣基督在被钉十字架三天后复活了。人们在一个叫做复活节的节日里纪念这个节日。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，那你什么时候庆祝复活节？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们在3月21日满月后的第一个星期天庆祝。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "怎么庆祝？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们做了很多复活节彩蛋，然后在上面画了一些图案。我们也会去教堂祈祷。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来很有趣。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "出租车。出租车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好，女士。去哪里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能帮我把包放到后备箱里吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没问题。上车吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "带我去希尔顿酒店。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，明白了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想吃块蛋糕吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用了，谢谢。我在节食。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？你不胖。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我正在考虑参加今年夏天的选美比赛，所以我的身材必须要很苗条。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果有自信，各种身材的女人都会很漂亮。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "恐怕评委们不这么认为。所有的选美比赛都是专为苗条女孩举办的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "泰国有一个专为胖美人举办的选美比赛。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "选手有多重？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "所有参加比赛的美女都超过80公斤。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但我不够胖，不能参加那个比赛。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不好意思，先生。你没看到红灯吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我还以为我可以在红灯处右转。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不可以，路标上写着红灯不许转弯。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我应该是没看到。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "打扰一下，请问能出示一下驾驶执照和保险单吗？我得给你开张罚单。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这儿呢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请在这里签名。你可以在14天内向法院上诉。这张纸条上所有信息都有。请安全驾驶，", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你，夫人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我哥哥去年参军了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，他长什么样？他高吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他又高又壮。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "从你的身材就能看出来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想买两张今晚音乐会的票。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。要什么样的座位？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "普通座。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，这是第13排的票。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得座位离舞台太远了。我要两个第六排的座位。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。但你得再加10美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真希望我的车能早点修好。天天坐公共上下班快把我累死了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不会吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有！以今天早上为例。早上的地铁太挤了，我上班的这一路上被大约上百个匆匆忙忙的乘客给挤扁了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "至少地铁比公共车好。一方面速度更快。而且通常不那么拥挤。但缺点是地铁比公共车贵。如果你每天坐地铁，花得也越来越多。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "确实。公共汽车更糟。一想到每天坐公交车上班就累了！嘿，你每天怎么上班？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我骑自行车。我住的地方不太远，所以很方便。从我家骑自行车到办公室只需十分钟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这也能锻炼身体。。。是个保持健康的好方法。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，不仅能锻炼，还能缓解压力。你坐公交感到精疲力竭时，我却在骑车释放一天的压力。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的朋友吉姆是做什么的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他是一名教师，但他没事的时候也修车赚点外快。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他会修车？我不信。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "相信我，他手艺一级棒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请问冰淇淋在哪？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在商店的尽头，就在你的右手边。所有的冰淇淋和冷冻食品都在冰箱里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我第一次来这里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请注意，我们所有的过道都有编号，并按天花板上面的标志分类。也许对你有帮助。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还好我问你了。所以这是6号过道，所有的水果罐头和蔬菜罐头都在这。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那边和詹姆斯说话的那个人是谁？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哪里？哦，那是亨利。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他很帅，对不对？他长什么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "其实，他人不错，但有点古怪。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的吗？我喜欢古怪的人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，但他可能对你来说也太古怪了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？你这是什么意思？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你没听说吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听说什么？没人给我说过任何事。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "显然，他和他的秘书有暧昧关系。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的吗！多迷人啊。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "据玛丽说，他要和妻子离婚了，关于孩子的事正在吵架。我以为大家都知道。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我能说什么？我不知道。哦，我应该早点告诉你，你的衬衫和你的裙子不太相配。那些颜色也不太适合你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦。谢谢。听着，我得去跟某人打个招呼。我马上回来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "艾莉森，你想再来点吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用了，谢谢。我够了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "实际上你没吃多少。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "说实话，我正在节食。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来很可笑。为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这几天我变胖了，我主要注意卡路里摄入。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "凯特，我从哪儿能得到信息？？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "问问约翰。他肯定知道这件事。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他参与了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道我在哪里能找到旧音乐盒吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以去跳蚤市场买东西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那是什么？我从没听说过这样的东西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "跳蚤市场是人们出售各种二手物品的户外场所。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，哪里有呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以查一下当地报纸或在网上搜索\"跳蚤市场\"。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他的鼻子不舒服，因为我们忘了邀请他参加聚会。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "亨利，你知道我们这个月花了多少钱吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，我不清楚。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们已经花了1000美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别大惊小怪，物价在上涨。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你一定为玛丽感到难过。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，她已经这样两个星期了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我担心她赶不上她的课。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也是。医生说她一个月后就会好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想已经解决了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我受够了你无聊的意见。你以为你是谁！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你竟敢这样对我说话。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你不记得你曾对我有好感了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想勾引我。我爱上你了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "顺便问一下，你明天去听音乐会吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我只是在想。也许我会去。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "爸爸，我做完作业了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想玩什么游戏？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "扑克呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道怎么玩吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我教你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的教我玩。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能帮我一下吗？我搬不动这个重箱子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "恐怕不行。你没看见我在用字典查单词吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得你只是在快速翻阅字典。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，那你等我一下。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "约翰，该起床了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "现在还不到起床的时间。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "到了。快点！你上学要迟到了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "几点？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "对。我们公司在这里有个办事处，我刚调过来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是我的电话。如果你需要有人带你四处走走，打电话给我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了。我很乐意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "自从我来到美国后，我发现这里和中国很不一样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有什么区别？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我朋友带我去商场购物，简直太大了。如果我一个人去的话我会迷路的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在商场里买了很多东西吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "其实不多。有人说周末有跳蚤市场，所以我决定去跳蚤市场买便宜货。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很明智。美国人有一个习惯，就是搬家后会卖很多东西，所以周末公园里，他们就会去卖东西。而且很多东西看起来都很新，也很有用。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我去帮您检查一下，先生。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你拿着手机在那里干什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在录移动日志！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "移动日志？那是什么意思？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，移动日志是\"手机\"和\"博客\"的结合。这是博客的另一种形式。用户可以通过手机或其他移动设备将博客发布到网上。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来很有趣！那一定很方便吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，你说得对。我可以随时随地写博客。当我在出差的时候，笔记本电脑恰好不在身边的时候，特别好用。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是怎么做到的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，如果我只是想写几句话，我会通过电子邮件发送，或者在手机浏览器上编辑。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果你想发布一些照片呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "然后我会拍一些照片，重新调整图片的大小，并上传文字说明到我的博客。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我懂了。对于你们这样的博客迷，移动日志肯定是帮了大忙了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "先生，今天加多少油？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我们可以检查一下你的油和轮胎吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我刚自己检查了机油，但你可以检查轮胎。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "（服务员给油箱加满油，清洁挡风玻璃，给轮胎加了点气。）好了，先生，26", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "5美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我来付钱。这是我的卡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能告诉我怎么使用图书馆吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。你只需要学生证或借书证就可以在图书馆借书、看期刊或杂志。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我一次可以借多少本书？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一次两本书。杂志或期刊除外，它们仅供馆内阅读。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这些书我能借多久？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一个月。如果不能及时还书，你会被罚款。但是如果你续借的话，你可以看更长的时间。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我懂了。现在我想借两本关于英语口语的书。你能告诉我在哪里能找到他们吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "就在你右边。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "对不起，请再告诉我一下您的姓名和订单好吗？我去查查为什么耽搁了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我叫斯坦利·莫里斯，点的是两份主厨沙拉。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你，莫里斯。请稍等，我查一下订单。先生，您要喝点什么吗？免费的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢吃甜食。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你到底想要什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想要些甜点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想要什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "哦，有好多！我喜欢辣妹。他们太酷了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我同意！他们解散时我哭了一个星期。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也很难过，但至少我还能听他们的CD。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那男孩吐了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真恶心。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谁打破了玻璃，彼得？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "谢谢你，史密斯先生。我今天要回中国。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我们可以花上一天的大部分时间去看房子，看我们必须看的东西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我打算在假期打工，分期付款。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果你需要帮助，告诉我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在吃什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "米饭。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "因为对你有好处。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我一般在电脑上获取大量信息，并通过邮件向朋友发送信息。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "当今世界有许多环境问题。你认为我们真的能解决所有问题还是会毁灭世界？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "每个人都关注短期问题，而不是长期问题。雨林的破坏也是如此。国家和公司只想要木材。他们没有考虑对森林的长期破坏。我们还应该记住，森林是成千上万种动植物的重要自然栖息地。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在世界其他地区，特别是在非洲，存在着荒漠化问题。气候变化和过度耕作让农田变成沙漠。这意味着人们无法种植作物。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "可以，这多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "只要700元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对我来说很贵。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这个怎么样？这是500元，材料和那一样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "这就是命运。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我为她感到难过。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许这是上帝的旨意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "你说的对。爱情在散沙上很快就会触礁。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "您打算租多少前的房子。？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "每月350-400美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。地点有特殊要求吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想住在大学附近，或者至少在公交线路上。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想什么时候搬进来？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "尽快。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "有许多有趣的地方你一定要去看看。然而，交通是一个问题。因为这座城市很古老，道路狭窄拥挤。如果你只有三四天的时间参观，你肯定不想浪费时间堵在出租车里。我建议你坐地铁。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "地铁？但是我住的酒店旁边有地铁站吗？我一天之内要在会议中心和旅馆之间往返好几次", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用担心，会议中心本身就有一个地铁站，从酒店到会议中心的班车只需5分钟。你个人观光的时候可以先坐班车到会议中心，然后转地铁。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "坐地铁贵吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以买张每日通行证，大概花6美元就可以在一天之内随意坐地铁穿行。否则，就要按行程付费，每次大约50美分到2美元，取决于你去的地方多远。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "容易迷路吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不。很难迷路的。有两条线，一条是圆的，另一条是直的。如果你迷路了，地铁服务员会帮你找到路的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是新来的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是你大学的第一年吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "其实我是从另一所学校转学来的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哪个学校？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我是从PCC转来的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我喜欢这里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你更喜欢这里还是PCC？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别误会。我喜欢这里，但PCC更好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那么，你为什么离开PCC？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "因为我拿到了AA，现在我要去攻读学士学位了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，蒂娜，我有个好消息。我成功地通过了ABC公司的前两轮面试。他们通知我下星期一参加决赛。看起来有戏哦。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "妈妈，你看到安迪的狗了吗?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "亲爱的，不要告诉我你也想要一只宠物狗。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "妈妈，求你了。我能养一只像安迪那条宠物狗一样的吗", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "亲爱的，你知道，我们没有足够的地方养一只宠物狗。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "妈妈，我们可以把它放在阳台上，对吧?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，亲爱的，阳台上全是箱子和物品 。我很抱歉。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "打扰一下，请问这附近有邮局吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有。23街拐角处有一家。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "怎么从这里到那边呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "向北走三个街区。邮局在墨西哥餐厅旁边。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有多远呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，非常近。步行大约5分钟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我有好几次都走投无路了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的？一般来说，都会出现转机的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你要竭尽所能摆脱出来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "约翰，如果你不介意的话，我想问你一个私人问题。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我一点也不介意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧。你结婚了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "说实话，我还没结婚。我还是单身。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那么，你打算什么时候结婚？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道。目前还没有想这个事。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我看见你的车在外面，所以我过去了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我偶尔来这里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "克里斯，我听说你来自一个大家庭。你家有多少人？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一共九个。七个孩子和我的父母。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "七个孩子？这么多。为什么你父母生这么多孩子？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我妈妈来自一个大家庭，她想有一个属于自己的大家庭。我父亲对于有没有大家庭无所谓，但我母亲说服了他。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "天哪，七个孩子。那肯定很麻烦。我们家有四个孩子，我的爷爷奶奶总是记不清我们的名字。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这会很难，而且你必须做出牺牲。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么样的牺牲？我是说没有隐私。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是一种牺牲。另一种是没有属于自己的东西。你所有的东西，从玩具到衣服，都和兄弟姐妹们共用。尤其是衣服。我衣柜里四分之三都是旧衣服。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "而且年龄差距也很烦人。我弟弟和我相差十岁。我们没有共同点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我家也有同样的问题。我家里最大的孩子和最小的孩子相差18岁。最小的孩子出生时，最大的孩子都要上大学了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你看！这张妈妈戴着帽子和长袍的照片。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真可爱！那是她从迈阿密大学拿到硕士学位的时候。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我们为她感到骄傲。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，这张你们一起拍的真不错。你有底片吗？我可以要一份吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然，我会给你做一个。你想要洗出来的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不。我想要张底片，我有一台新的放映机。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想亲眼看看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也给我洗出来一张钱包大小的吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有什么问题吗，警官？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我因为你闯红灯而拦了你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你不知道？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道我闯红灯了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你不知道黄色代表慢下来吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，女士。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你为什么要加速？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真的没有借口，女士。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我得给你开张罚单。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我明白，我很抱歉。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是你的罚单。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好，李明。你看起来不开心啊。怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这个星期六我们班要开家长会，我很担心。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？那天我们可以早放学了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我上次考试考得不好。如果我父亲知道，会揍我的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真不敢相信。我父母从不打我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道的，我父亲易怒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以向老师求助。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好主意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好，你们有空房吗?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，刚开了一间。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是什么样的公寓?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是一间一室一卫的公寓。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您去哪里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "去火车站。你能把我的行李放进后备箱吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的但是让我换个地方停车。好的，小姐。行李在哪里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在那边。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这么多行李。您带了什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "只是我买的礼物。别担心。不重。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是什么让你感到压力最大？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可能是我父母。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，上学时，他们希望我成绩好。工作后，他们想让我找一份更好的工作。最后，他们要我结婚。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你必须面对来自父母的巨大压力。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你父母不那样吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "自从小学成绩不好后，他们就对我不抱希望了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你真幸运。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你怎么处理压力？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我无能为力。压力如影随形。我有时和朋友出去喝酒，但那只是暂时的解决办法。第二天压力又回来了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太糟糕了。你想去喝杯啤酒吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。听起来不错。走吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是新来的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是我来这里的第一天。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是大学新生吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我在别的地方上学。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你从哪所学校转学的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我从PCC来的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你为什么要转学？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的成绩不够好，考不上这。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你喜欢PCC吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢PCC。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "祝你好运。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很高兴来到这里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得汤姆怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我非常喜欢他。他是一个快活的人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你准备好迎接他了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我准备好了。他随时都可以来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可以试穿这件衣服吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然可以。（=好的。）", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好，迈克尔。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好，托德。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们聊聊澳大利亚。或者你说说澳大利亚。那么首先，澳大利亚人是怎么生活的呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "澳大利亚？哦，现在澳大利亚有近两千万人口，不足但接近两千万。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，最大的城市是？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "最大的城市？最大的城市是悉尼，然后是墨尔本，然后是布里斯班，然后是珀斯。但大多数大城市都在澳大利亚东海岸。只有珀斯这个大城市在西海岸。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的嗯，如果你必须住在一个地方，你会住在哪里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢布里斯班。我十几岁的时候在布里斯班，在布里斯班长大，嗯，或者悉尼，因为是一座大城市，但是布里斯班有黄金海岸和阳光。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，不错。那澳大利亚的首都是哪？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "啊，堪培拉是首都。但不是最大的城市。悉尼是最大的城市。堪培拉在某种程度上是由政客们打造的，这样悉尼就不会拥挤了。这是一个单独的领域。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我穿这件衣服好看吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，当然。就像量身订做的一样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我觉得这个更适合我。多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "120美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "今天是星期四。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天几号？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天是2003年5月1日。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，今天是国际劳动节。今天是我们的工作日吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不这么认为。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "爸爸，你知道妈妈在哪里吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想她正在房间里整理一些东西，让你带去学校。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她最好不要像平常那样开始哭。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道，但她会很想念你的。我告诉过你我有多为你骄傲吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "爸爸，现在你别再缠着我了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我是认真的。你真的向我们证明了你已经准备好面对成人世界了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "谢谢你", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你最喜欢哪条牛仔裤？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很喜欢直腿的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但不是很时髦。这些呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不喜欢这种下垂的款式。感觉像个修水管的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "就是这种风格的！你只穿四脚裤。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果有人拽我裤子呢？那怎么办？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你太老土了！没人会拽你裤子的！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "八道。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么时候？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今晚八点，能给我们安排一间包房吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，包房已经订满了。你想改天再预订吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许不了，那还是谢谢你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿，杰夫，你的音响呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我需要钱，所以上个星期我把它当了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你一定很缺钱才这么做。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "你最喜欢她什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她很有趣。她总是让我笑。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "你可以选择DEL或拨号网。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那两个谁最好？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我推荐DEL。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那个更好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，因为它不占用电话。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你这是什么意思？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "DEL没有通过你的电话线连接，但拨号网是。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我上网就不能打电话了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错。有了DEL，你可以同时进行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "不，并不是。我一开始在伦敦的一所大学工作，但随着时间的推移，我发现我并不喜欢这份工作。就决定试试其他领域。新闻业对我来说非常适合，同时也是一种挑战。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你喜欢现在的工作吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "哦，天哪，别再这样了。我们上周就是这么做的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，我们没有。上周我们去看了那部关于一个男人与精神疾病作斗争的电影。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对，这是一部女性电影，就像这部一样，有什么区别？另外，这是《破坏者》系列第三部电影上映的最后一周，我想在大银幕上。动作片就要在电影院的大银幕上看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，是的，我答应过如果我们上周去看那部电影的话，我会和你一起看的。但是你喜欢那部电影，不是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "好的。让我查一下。哦，您好像是对的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "税和服务费怎么算？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "帐单上只包括百分之十的税。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那么一百美元就够了，不是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "确实是这样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "但现在人数有变化。我们有七个人。我的三个朋友很快就要来了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系。请跟我来。你觉得餐厅中央的桌子怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但我们订的是靠窗的桌子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，但是你看，靠窗的桌子都很小，最多有4个座位。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我明白了。我们只有将就一下坐在大厅中间了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢您的理解，提姆先生。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "嗯，很难说。我晚上咳嗽得厉害。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你最好戒烟。这对你的健康有害。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说得对。但是你知道戒烟这样的老毛病很难戒掉。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但你应该先下定决心。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道我经常要工作到深夜。我需要抽烟来保持清醒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你为什么不早睡早起呢？你上班的时间是一样的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你的建议。我试试看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能给我便宜一点的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我知道你为什么生气，威尔逊夫人。相信我，我们正在尽全力解决这个问题。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很明显，你做的还不够好！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "很遗憾，这个牛排是招牌菜，但却不是很新鲜。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很抱歉听到这个消息。因为我们每天都从市场上买牛排，一般不会听到这样的反馈。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那又怎么样？牛排不新鲜，我也不高兴。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "那我就预订晚上9点的四人座。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我会去的。哦，吧台有服务费吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "嗯嗯，我要去见一个客户。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太可惜了！我只在这里住一晚！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，鲍勃。如果你告诉我你要来，我今晚就提前空出来了。但你没说。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是今天早上，我老板突然冲进办公室，叫我赶过来参加会议，我才知道的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一般都是亨利去开会。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，但他昨晚开车过来时出了事故，被送进了医院。所以我改做了。玛丽，你今晚必须出去吗？你不能不去吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我明天有空，但可能太晚了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，我再呆一天。我老板那边没事的。明天和我一起吃午饭好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想去。但是鲍勃，你确定没事吗？我怕你惹老板生气，甚至怕你丢掉工作。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系。我会打电话给老板，告诉他我要再呆一天。上个月我在波士顿多住了一晚，他似乎对此毫不在意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你为什么在波士顿多住一晚？发生什么事了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "他可以花更多的时间和孙子孙女在一起。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我觉得他不想。他想去环游世界。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "所以，他想有一个更积极的退休生活。好主意！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "一个月150。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "你的BAC超过了法定限额。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但我……", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我得给你开罚单，扣押你的车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我的天！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我昨晚住在鲍勃家。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很担心你在哪儿。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想我应该告诉你的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，你应该这么做。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的房子很旧。需要重新装修吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，它真的需要重新装修。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我还以为你帮不上忙。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我知道！我也不想学习！但我要参加数学速成班。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为了考大学，我必须参加考试，所以我需要准备。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你认为这会有帮助吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "必须有帮助！我每天都在学习，一天八小时！我不知道，但这所学校人才辈出。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯。。。也许我也应该报名。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我明天去学校给你拿一张申请表。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我们不给小费。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不给小费？这真是一个文明的社会。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在酒店和餐馆里，他们会在账单上加上服务费，但除此之外，我们不习惯给小费。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "出租车司机和搬运工呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在出租车里，你只要按计价器上写的付就行了。我一般给旅馆搬运工每件行李10元小费，但在一流的酒店里，他们是不允许接受小费的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果你想在这里引进这种系统，你需要一场革命。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的巴西之行怎么样？你学到什么了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想到巴西多么重视足球！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可不是吗", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的。你可以看到，在他们的街道中间有公园，大足球场。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真正的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还不止这些。人们会使用那些场地！每天晚上男人，女人，孩子都在外面，直到凌晨3点和4点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是认真的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道他们第二天怎么上班！就像他们以足球为生！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们先喝点汤好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "那我们喝点白葡萄酒好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，但我更喜欢红酒和肉。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想要什么甜点？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我认为我只想喝杯咖啡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，晚饭后，我们去迪斯科舞厅好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用了，谢谢。我想直接回家。我很累。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "打扰一下，饭前喝一杯好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想喝点什么吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我知道了。我要一杯啤酒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢。多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "你确定吗？那我再多来点啤酒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别担心。我过一会儿又会回来的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你吃完了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "你今晚有什么晚餐上的安排吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，我想在烤箱里放个冷冻披萨什么的。你呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我在想也许我们今晚可以一起做晚饭。你怎么认为？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我一点也不会做饭！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可以教你怎么做健康的菜。冷冻披萨对身体不好！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道它们对你不好，但是它们便宜，方便，而且相当美味。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我最近在马加迪兹餐厅看到了一份辣咖喱鸡的食谱。也许我们可以试试？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊，为什么不呢。所有的原料都有吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我今天早上买了所有的原料，我们开始吧！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们先做什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "首先，你需要把蔬菜洗干净，然后把它们切成小块。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。我要把锅加热吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。一旦热了，放一点油进去，加入蔬菜炒几分钟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那鸡肉呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "它需要切成约3厘米长的细条，然后可以单独炒，直到熟透。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "米饭呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我来准备。你喜欢白米还是糙米？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "上来吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "交通拥堵的时候开车很麻烦。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想是的。你必须要耐心，小心。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "所以我宁愿步行或跑步去上班。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你一定是在开玩笑！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "鲍勃，我真的很生你的气。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，我不是故意忘记我们的结婚纪念日的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你去年也忘了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道，对不起。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你们两个在这里干什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们听说你不舒服，所以来看看你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我坐在那里发名牌，突然，她出现了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谁，费米？是啊，易军在里面看到她了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "舞会之夜的所有记忆都浮现在我脑海中。我不得不一个人待着。你记得那晚吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我记得有人给我的潘趣酒里加酒。你和我坐在女厕所里。。。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得劳动大军中对妇女的歧视在今天仍然很普遍吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "从我作为职业女性的亲身经历来看，我不得不说，虽然现在的情况比过去有所好转，但这仍然是一个普遍存在的问题。社会在变化，但在许多职业领域，女性仍的发展然面临天花板。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你认为天花板现象是因为传统的社会习俗吗？还是有更多的因素在起作用？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我认为这是一个非常复杂的问题。妇女在劳动力市场上发展困难的部分原因是由于机会少和男性管理人员多。别小看当前的体制。男人有权力，所以他们更容易继续掌权。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "平权行动呢？立法没有改变等级制度吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "平权行动给了我们管理配额，禁止性别歧视，但这仍然是一个男人的世界。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得有点不舒服。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能来真是太好了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好久不见了，是吧？你最近怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很好，谢谢。你呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好极了，谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "抱歉，先生，请问去艾丹书店怎么走？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想步行去还是坐公车去？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "呃", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "离这儿远吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "步行大约十分钟就到了。沿着这条街走，在第三个十字路口处，你会发现就在你左边。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我走路吧。谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不客气。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大米真的是东南亚大部分地区的主食吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不是专家，但我是这么认为的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "米饭也是你的主食吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用说，作为西方人，我的主食是面包。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "兰迪，没想到在这里见到你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我是来旅游的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "世界很小，不是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，世界很小。我们没法预料会在哪里遇到认识的人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "所以大家可以去为他们的母校加油吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，还可以重温往昔美好的高中时光。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你听起来就一副不想去的样子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "确实不想去，我一想到就胃疼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是怕见到你的前女友费米紧张吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哎哟，太伤心了-你非得提她的名字吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有桌吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯嗯，我们有很多桌子存货。你要看看这个吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "颜色不错，款式也不错，就是有点太小了。我想要一个稍大一点的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这件怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我喜欢。多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "七十美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "钱给你。你能把这个送到我家吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然可以，随时为您服务。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是我的名片。谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "如果我今天晚上十点左右再打电话会不会太晚了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系。我们不早睡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得很痛苦。你知道的，妻子的死让我很难过。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "振作起来！过去的就让它过去吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我试过了，不行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "看来你得花点时间。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "打扰一下，我在地图上的哪个地方？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你就在这里，汽车站，我们在市中心。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我该坐哪路车去火车站？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以坐2路公汽。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在哪换车呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在憧憬街。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你今天打算穿什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我打算穿这件新衬衫。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你最好把衬衫掖好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我喜欢宽松着穿", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那么，这是你第一次来台湾吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不是，我第一次来是1995年。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，真的吗？你是美国人，对吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "额，我其实是来自加拿大。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我很抱歉。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系。这种情况经常发生。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢你的手镯。你什么时候买的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我前段时间买的，但没怎么戴。你真的觉得不错？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊。很漂亮。白金的还是银的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "白金的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你从哪儿弄来的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我男朋友带我去了沙恩珠宝。他让我随便挑。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了。是为了庆祝什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这才是最棒的部分。不是为了庆祝。他只是想给我买点东西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你真幸运。如果他给你买东西不是为了庆祝某个特殊的日子，我想知道他会给你买什么作为生日礼物。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的生日快到了。我们很快就会知道的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想要什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他可以送我项链。我在珠宝店逛的时候，看到几条想要的漂亮项链。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么不买个戒指？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我还没准备好接受他的戒指。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但你可以接受其他礼物？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "亨利娶罗斯是为了她父亲的钱，对吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的。但他很快就后悔了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但他似乎和罗斯在一起很开心。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "与其说他聪明，不如说他善良。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想要几个房间的房子？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，四五个吧。这套公寓的租金是多少？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一个月150。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "150？算了，我实际上对这儿不太感兴趣，地方不够大而且离我办公室不够近。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你喜欢什么游戏？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢文字游戏。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "喜欢桥牌吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我一点也不喜欢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "猜谜游戏呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不适合。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们玩别的游戏吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "围棋怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你最近看起来很沮丧。怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我破产了，现在身无分文。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果我能为你做什么，请尽管告诉我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你丈夫很乐于助人，不是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许愿意帮忙，但不像你想的能帮到别人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真正的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "昨天晚上他给孩子们讲故事，他们俩都吓得睡不着觉。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天是中国新年！该吃火锅了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们吃那种既有辛辣又有清汤的吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是说鸳鸯锅吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的。这样我就可以满足我对辛辣食物的渴望，你也可以吃火锅而不至于辣的不行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好主意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "走吧！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，我睡过头了。我的闹钟今天早上没响。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "再一次？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，但我昨晚确实设置了闹钟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的闹钟从来没响过。也许你应该买一个新的了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好。如果明天还坏，我一定会买一个新的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许那时就太晚了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说太晚是什么意思？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "到那时，你就要被解雇了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的管道出了问题，需要修理。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "管道有什么问题？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "冲厕所很慢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "厨房的管道有问题吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "厨房和洗手间的管道都一团糟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这种情况多久了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有一阵子了，但是今天早上更糟了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我会派人去检查下，今天下午您在家吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我在家。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，我大概两点到。如果没人在家，就用万能钥匙开门进去。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好，打扰一下，先生? 我想买双皮鞋。 我穿了多年的那双鞋终于变形了。 他们已经不能穿了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然可以，你想买什么样的鞋? 我们有系带凉鞋、光滑的高跟鞋、前卫的浅口鞋，如果你想买更实用的，我们有玛丽·珍妮牌芭蕾舞鞋。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请给我看看经典的高跟鞋。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，这边走。 你想要什么颜色的?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "黑色的。 经典。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然可以。 我们这里有这种款式很流行。 因为它是露趾鞋，一年四季都可以穿。 每个人穿起来都很好看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯。 太亮。 而且我穿连裤袜和鞋子，所以让我们找一双封闭式的鞋。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，这是一双非常漂亮的皮鞋，两英寸的鞋跟，非常舒服。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不喜欢尖头的。 让我看看你们还有什么。 太高了。 这条裤子的后背好像能切进我的脚后跟。 我的脚背很高，所以我怀疑穿起来是否合适。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么尺寸?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "七号半。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "找到了。 合身吗?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯。 不好的。 太紧了。 长度是对的，但是鞋子太窄了，夹到我的脚趾。 也没有地方放我的鞋垫了。 你知道吗? 我想我没有耐心了", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "祝你今天愉快，女士。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好，打扰一下！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好！有什么我能帮你的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯嗯，我想知道去市区的巴士在哪里。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "直走然后右转，你会看到那里有一个大汽车站。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，我知道了。谢谢你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不客气！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好，欢迎来到葡萄酒世界。需要帮忙叫叫我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯嗯，我需要一些帮助。我今晚要去老板家吃饭，不知道该带什么酒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，会有哪些食物呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他的妻子是日本人，做的寿司很好吃。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，有点难度。众所周知，寿司很难与葡萄酒搭配。好吧，我看看。当然得配白葡萄酒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？红酒不适合寿司吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。寿司非常美味的食物，而红酒则有一种强烈的反差。白葡萄酒味道更微妙，正好和鱼搭配。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道了。我要带一瓶夏敦埃酒吗？那是白葡萄酒，对吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯嗯，夏敦埃酒是白葡萄酒，但这可能并不是最好的选择。夏敦埃酒比较浓烈，而且有点橡木味。我建议你买淡点的，比如新西兰的长相思。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "长相思？那是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那是另一种葡萄酒，或者说是另一种葡萄酿造的，就像夏敦埃酒一样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我看看。标签上说\"诱人的柑橘和青草的芳香，非常松脆，有矿物口感，并且是全干的，适宜冷藏后食用\"。哦，天，这酒要冷藏多久？我马上就要吃晚饭烈。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系，别担心，我们只是从冷柜里选瓶酒。我们没有那么多的选择，但是", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "罗纳河白酒很不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧。是用什么酿造的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，这是法国葡萄酒，所以标签上没有注明品种。法国人认为葡萄生长的土壤是影响葡萄酒最终风味最重要因素之一。这种酒可能是由几种不同类型的葡萄混合而成的，我觉得最多的是维欧尼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得这是好酒吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯嗯，这是我们的畅销酒之一。这不像我们之前看到的长相思那么干，更平易近人，更清脆，带有一点香草的香味。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "完美，那我就要了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我已经五年没见你父亲了。他怎么样了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他过得不太好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大约一年前，他开始感到虚弱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是因为年纪大了还是病了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许两者都有吧。医生没具体说是什么。我想是因为他年轻时没有照顾好自己。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有道理的。年轻的时候注意身体健康是很重要的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我父亲几乎每天都这么跟我说。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，我希望他能好起来。代我向他问好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢。我会转达的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我认为今年公司会选在山上疗养。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好主意！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一月很适合山上疗养。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢这个主意，但我不太确定一月合不合适。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道，现在我一想，觉得你可能是对的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "四月可能会很好。我们会有足够的时间做准备。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "建议不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们可以问问大家的想法。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，这样我们就能知道怎么办最好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天下午我会把问卷放到网上。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得这些菜怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很好，色泽艳丽，美味可口。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你喜欢晚餐吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我喜欢。我从没吃过这样的东西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想再来点米饭吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用了，谢谢。我吃饱了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "再来一块肉馅饼？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用了，谢谢。我在节食。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "甜点怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "冰淇淋吧，谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们今年会得到一大笔奖金，是吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别指望了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "早上好，王小姐。你今天看起来真漂亮！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢。我在化妆。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谁教你化妆的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我在一家美容店学过化妆。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能教我怎么化妆吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。首先，用眼影来提高你的眼睛。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你认为什么样的眼影最适合我？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我认为粉红色的眼影在中国女孩中很受欢迎。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你怎么样保持嘴唇滋润？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我建议你使用唇膏，它也能保护你的嘴唇。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的指甲怎么这么长？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你要注意不时修剪它们。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "轮到你了，先生。很抱歉让您等这么久。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系。麻烦帮我拿下那支蓝钢笔。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，给您，这是中国最好的牌子之一。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道了。谢谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你完成工作了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有，因为我在看孩子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "孩子的妈妈去哪了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她去楼下的超市了。她说大约半小时后回来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你又在撒谎吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果我说谎，就被绞死。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧。但有什么问题吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的车没油了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。那么你觉得我们应该在什么方面省钱呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我们不能吃太多了。那300美元的娱乐费大部分是去餐厅吃饭花掉的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是，是个好主意，而且你喜欢做饭。那书呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不行，书我是需要的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "得了吧！如果我们能存更多的钱，可以早点儿退休，那你就真正有时间去读那些你买的书了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，那你花在衬衫上的50美元呢？你本可以花更少的钱买到的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，让我们各退一步吧。如果你同意只花75美元买书，我就同意下次买衬衫只花40美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好。听起来挺公平的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道谁刚结婚吗？老麦克唐纳。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "怎么可能！他已经80多岁了，不是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他快90岁了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "天哪！你确定？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我确定。而且，他的妻子已经84岁了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的。你猜怎么着，他是她的第六任丈夫。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的？真是个不得了的女人，不是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好。社会新闻。有什么能帮助你的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好。我叫杰西卡·史密斯。我想取消报纸订阅。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "从下个月的第一天开始。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "马奎特，你觉得我是否要选科学课？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得要，如果你想今年毕业，你必须修一门理科课程。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，我想既然你在学医学预科，你肯定了解这些课程。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我学生物、化学、地图和物理。你需要的是一门好的非理科专业的入门课程。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我在地图方面真的很不擅长，我在高中时这门课成绩就很差。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是个问题。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你通常都去哪儿买东西，莱恩夫人？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我一般会去车站附近的超市。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得那里价钱怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得价格公道，蔬菜也很新鲜。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我看你买了些咖啡。能告诉我花了多少钱吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "就花了2美元25美分。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我能问一下你什么时候出生的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "1963年5月20日。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道农历是什么时候吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "四月二十七日。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对了，你能告诉我电影什么时候开始吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "五点半开始。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我太冷了，没法准时到了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以明天再看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不想错过今天的比赛。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "再见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得我的新跑车怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很酷。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您要点喝的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你们的酒单在哪？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "葡萄酒单在桌子中间的小菜单上。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这里调制饮料吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们可以在酒吧里调一些饮料。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我听说你的酒很有名。你们有什么特色饮品吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们的招牌酒是库埃沃金色玛格丽塔。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我现在正好想喝一杯玛格丽塔！我就点这个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "需要我为您准备加冰块的饮料吗，还是您喜欢不加冰的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我要加冰块的玛格丽塔。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你喜欢加盐的玛格丽塔还是不加盐的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请不要加盐。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你这么快就来了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没事。有什么事情？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我房子里的一根管子漏水了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哪里的管子？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "浴室里的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "漏了多久了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这管子已经漏水好几天了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道我得拆掉你的墙才能找到水管，对吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我知道。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这样行吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我只需要把问题修好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我现在就开始。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天人们听说了信息高速公路和互联网。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这种改变会对你我这样的人有益吗。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想有的。我的朋友以前主要上网下棋，但现在他学会了如何在网上做其他事情。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "毫无疑问，互联网将是一个强大的商业媒介。它将连接数以亿计的客户，为各种产品和服务打开巨大的市场。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那是真的。我可以想象公司通过网络直接向客户发送广告。反过来，顾客可以检查和比较他们想买的任何商品，并以最优惠的价格找到它们。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊。哪会是一个购物天堂。这就是网络在电子商务中的应用。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们该怎么办？我不能把车从沟里弄出来。我卡住了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很担心，汤姆。我已经快一个小时没看到别的车了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道。这太可怕了。我们能做什么？这雪还没停下来！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我告诉过你我们今天应该留在城里。天气预报说有100%的可能下雪。你为什么要来这里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想带你看看小屋。我们只剩下半小时了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，现在我们被困住了。我们能做什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我听说当这种情况发生时，节约能源是很重要的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你什么意思？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们被困在这里了，汤姆。我们可能在这里很久了。我们需要节省车里的汽油。汽车的能量能使我们保暖。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我有很多汽油。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，但是汽油和电池都得继续工作。我们不能让汽车跑啊跑啊跑。如果我们这样做，它很快就会死的。那我们就冻僵了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我们该怎么办？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "把灯关了，然后每小时只开15分钟左右的车和暖气，这样可以尽可能长时间地保持热量。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧。这是个好主意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真希望我们没上来。现在我们可能要在这里呆上几天。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "几天？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，这是经常发生的。这就是大暴风雪的情况。人们被困了好几天。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，天哪！很好我们有食物。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许我们能活下来。但是把车熄火大约45分钟。然后我们再打开它。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，不！现在我要迟到了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "需要我帮你一把吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，如果你能开车送我到市区，我将不胜感激。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。我有时间。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能帮我把这个管子缩短吗？太长了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然可以。午饭后我再做。你需要多长？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能缩短15毫米吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以，没问题。下午2点就做好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我担心她会迷路。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "放松。她对这个地区很熟悉。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "毕竟，她只是个五岁的孩子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也是，我出去找她。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "需要帮忙吗", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我的刹车失灵了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "刹车怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "踩刹车时，我听到噪音并感觉到震动。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "前刹车？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我认为是这样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是什么车？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "丰田卡罗拉2002。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "写下你的名字和地址，把钥匙给我，我会检查的的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "要收费吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "要花多长时间？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大约半小时。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我会等的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "亨利，我想问你一件事。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "尽管问。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你看。工资还没有发，你能不能借给我一些钱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很抱歉。我没有钱可以借给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请给我三张25美分的邮票。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给你。七十五美分。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请用挂号信寄这封信。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "里面有什么值钱的东西吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有一张两百美元的支票和一张照片。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "需要要开收据吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，不用麻烦了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "总共九十五美分。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我丈夫每晚都和朋友出去喝酒。我受够了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许你们两个应该去咨询婚姻顾问。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你昨晚看了世界杯的实况转播吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我错过了。我当时在看音乐会的现场演出。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "乐队叫什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "爱音乐的女人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，午饭吃什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道。你想吃什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想吃披萨。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我昨天吃过了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，你想吃什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以吃汉堡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "前几天我刚吃了汉堡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们还是妥协吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你吃你的汉堡，我吃我的比萨。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们到哪里去买这两个？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以在自助餐厅买。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "生日快乐，爱丽丝，这是给你的小礼物。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢你，大卫。这是一份极好的生日礼物。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "想吃点甜点吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，我想尝尝蓝莓派。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。（他给她拿了馅饼。她吃完后，服务员回来了。）你还要别的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用了，我吃饱了。可以结账了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给你。谢谢你，祝你晚上愉快。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "宋，我不想说再见，但不得不说了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很高兴见到你，凯文。我希望能再见到你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "保持联系。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。那再见了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "打扰一下。我叫大卫·沃克。我们以前没见过面吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，让我看看。。。你在IBM公司工作吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "现在我想起来了。我们去年在东京开会时见过面。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "欢迎光临。有什么能够帮到您的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们想看看你们的产品。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请这边走。我们的产品种类齐全，从化妆品到皮肤清洁用品都有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能给我推荐一些润肤霜吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的T区容易出油，但脸颊冬天很干燥。我说得对吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，没错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这款\"橄榄霜\"是我们针对混合性皮肤的畅销用品。你可以在手上试试。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，好的，我要买这个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，别的还要吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不了。谢谢你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的荣幸。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的空调坏了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "交给我，我来修。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "亚当，你能带我参观一下学校吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那座最高的建筑物是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是说操场附近的白色建筑？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那是图书馆。有超过10万本书。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "图书馆南边的那栋楼是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道的，我们学校分为初中和高中两部分。那是我们高中的新教学楼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你们学校有游泳池吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有。有一个很大的游泳池，但只有夏天才开。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真羡慕你。我希望有一天我能上你们学校。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我相信你能梦想成真。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你怎么敢说是我偷了你的电脑？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很抱歉，但你是唯一能接触到它的人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "张先生，你反对喝红茶吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，所以我从不喝。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那你喝绿茶吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很少，因为茶中含有丹宁酸，可能对健康有害。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但是，如果茶是好的，泡的适宜，是大有好处的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有什么好处？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不仅能解渴，而且在疲倦时也能提神。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，但决不能泡得太久。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "因为如果你喝了泡了很长时间的茶，不利于身体健康。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的公司要开一个聚会；我该穿什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是正式的还是非正式的场合？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想这是一个正式的会议，因为总干事会在那里发表演讲，大多数工作人员都会参加。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那样的话，正式的西装配上漂亮的领带就更好了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是对的。鞋子呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "棕色皮鞋还可以。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不客气。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，鲍勃。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的驾驶考试考得怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "通过了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了，这是你的第一次尝试。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "现在几点？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "现在是十点半。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你喜欢打乒乓球吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你什么时候开始的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "几年前。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不好意思。你能把纸巾递给我吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然，给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢，我没想到这道菜这么辣。你还好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我觉得这道菜还不错，虽然对我来说有点咸，但不太辣。但你是中国人，你应该更清楚。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不是每个中国人都能像四川和贵州人那么能吃辣。在我家乡，人们怎么吃胡椒和辣椒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，那我知道你为什么吃不了这道菜了。深表同情。我在四川呆了一年。一开始我也吃不了那么辣。每道菜都很辣。过一段时间我就懂了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，你可以增加你对辛辣食物的承受能力，但到目前为止，我还没有这个必要或机会。每次我尝试辛辣的食物，我的鼻子和眼睛都很难受。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我完全理解。起初我也不是有意喜欢吃辣，但当你没有其他选择时，你必须适应。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错，典型的入乡随俗嘛。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "史蒂文，你互联网的生意怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别提了。今年我为此损失了一大笔钱。我觉得可能要破产了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真遗憾。这表明，你应该购买的是公司，而不是创意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也改变了策略。我现在在投资好公司。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我同意你的看法。我很快就会找到一家好公司投资的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好主意。但这次投资时要谨慎些。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我会的。我应该向你多学习。毕竟我是新手。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果你有什么问题，可以问我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，我妻子刚刚给我发了条短信，要我回家。我得走了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧。我们下次再聊吧。再见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "再见。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们不能走那条路，这条路之后几天都不通。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，对。要在上面拍电影，是不是？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "应该是要拍高速追逐的场景。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想知道该地区的企业对此有何看法。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得他们都获得了回报。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "电影公司要付钱给他们吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不知道，但想想看，他们可以得到免费宣传！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，是的，他们上了电影，全世界都能看到！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这个城市有什么特点？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们有一个美丽的自然公园。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "值得一去。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "来吧。我们走过去吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你准备好了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "准备好干什么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你准备好明天转学了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。我准备好了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你不紧张吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我当然紧张。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你最紧张的是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那个学校里我一个人都不认识。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那你不必紧张。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "认识新朋友是件好事。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这么想也不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，你好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很好。你呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "马马虎虎。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在车上坐了很久了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我大概十五分钟前上车的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你多久坐一次公汽？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我一般都是开车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你有自己的车吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我有自己的车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那为什么不开呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我在等总统降低油价。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真聪明。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我说，你好！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你怎么了，特德？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我在说法语。难道你一点也不会吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "说英语不好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我刚从语言学校回来。在那里我们整天都得说法语。不准说英语！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你为什么这样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我在努力学习新技能。能让我找到一份更好的工作。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "好啊，我的蛋只煎一面就好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我都不知道你还能这样吃鸡蛋！从我小的时候起，我就这么吃。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道吗，二十年来我爸爸每天早上都做炒蛋。把我妈逼疯了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道让我抓狂的是什么吗？我想要水煮蛋，但他们老是煮过头了，煮成全熟的鸡蛋。你怎么能把吐司蘸进煮熟的鸡蛋里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你有时候太挑剔了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给你，亲爱的，煎蛋。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "请给我账单好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一共多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "总共185美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "包括饮料费吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是200美元，请不要找了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在这里学习，是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。我在这里已经三年了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你喜欢这所学校吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这个嘛。我对此相当失望。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "它太旧了。而且也不像我想象的那么好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦。这很可怕，但没办法。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我只能忍了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "玛丽，我听说你又搬家了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是 啊。我受不了再住在这里了。附近总是很吵。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你是说噪音？怎么可能呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道的，周末我们想睡懒觉的时候，邻居就开始大吵大闹。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你父亲怎么样了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他已经好几天没去上班了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他得了重感冒。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，告诉他放松点，我希望他会感觉好些。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢。我会告诉他的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我看你买了最新的《美丽与时尚》。里面有什么有意思的文章吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一位顶级时装设计师就最新时装进行了一次有意思的采访。我喜欢读她的想法。这个月还有什么的版块很有趣？他们测试了面部清洁剂。T", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢做杂志上的测试。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说的是哪个测试？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你知道的。你有多嫉妒？你是时尚受害者吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我明白了。我也喜欢做那些测试，但我不太当真。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然不能完全当真了，但有时候测试结果会让你反思自己和自己的行为。从嫉妒测试来看，我是一个很容易产生嫉妒的人。也许我需要控制我的嫉妒心。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说得对。有时很难分辨哪些是广告，哪些是文章。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想要一张公交卡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您想要什么样的公交卡？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有哪些选择？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有单日，单月，单周的公交卡，还有学生卡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想要学生卡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "让我看看您的学生证。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "非常感谢", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "公交卡要多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢惠顾。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今晚是我的第一次约会。你能给我一些穿搭建议吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我觉得你可以穿紫色圆点连衣裙，头发盘在后面。那样显得非常优雅和神秘。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，这是个好主意。让我试试。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "记得搭配你那条闪闪发光的星形项链。正式场合戴它非常引人注目。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "穿高跟鞋会显得更成熟吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然，更优雅也更高。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我要化淡妆，不化浓妆。粉底可以提亮我的肤色。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果我是你的约会对象，我会被你迷住的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，味道很好。让我们结帐吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好。我们各付各的吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不。这次我请客。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你总是那么好客。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在课堂上只说英语，还是你的老师用西班牙语向你解释一切？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我们上课从不说西班牙语！帕克小姐只跟我们说英语。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想她是对的。她英语说得很慢吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不总是这样。有时我们不理解她，她就必须重复她说的话。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "学英语一定很有趣。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "马里奥和我是班上最好的学生。帕克小姐说我的发音很好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "英语发音容易吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有时候很难。有些单词的发音方式看起来不一样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "咱们休息一下。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好主意。来杯咖啡怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "去那儿最便宜的方法是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "乘地铁。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是吗？这附近有地铁站吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有。在大楼的另一边有一个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很好。我能穿过这栋楼过去吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "恐怕不能。你得绕过去。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道了。非常感谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，我叫皮特。你是安。是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，皮特，你怎么知道我的名字？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你看见那个穿红上衣的女孩了吗？她告诉我的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "噢，安德里亚，那个西班牙女孩？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，就是她。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我上周在一个聚会上见过她。对啦，你一定是从美国来的吧？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "实际上我住在伦敦，但我家在西雅图。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我也是伦敦人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你住在伦敦哪里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在温布尔登——实际上离网球场很近。这很好，因为我喜欢网球。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我每周都去那里打网球。哪天我们一起玩好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那太好了。现在我们去喝一杯。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "打扰一下，您能告诉我去霍尔顿火车站的路吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然可以。离这很远。不过，别担心。去那里挺容易。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想我走错方向了，对吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的。首先您需要转过方向来。您还记得这条路上经过了几个红绿灯吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "记得，我记得。它们在约两英里外的地方，对吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。开回交通要道然后右转。沿着这条路走大约一英里，直到看到一家广场酒店。这是一家非常大的酒店。您一定能看到。然后在酒店处左转。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "所以，我在道路两英里外的红绿灯处右转，然后在广场酒店左转，沿着那条路走一英里。我知道了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "然后您就一直直走，您会看到前面有车站。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。知道了。谢谢您的帮助。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这个落地灯怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以，去拿吧！我们买家具已经五个小时了！我太累了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们还需要找个衣橱和梳妆台。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧！我要回家把床头柜、咖啡桌和双人沙发放下，你再找其他的东西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好！大约一个小时后来接我吧，因为我还想找一个豆袋坐垫和一套餐具。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能挑一个好的躺椅吗？我真的想要一个，这样我就可以看电视了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "躺椅？放在我装饰精美的客厅里？我不这么认为！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿，安，昨晚的事我真的很抱歉。我不该对你说那样的话。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我也很抱歉。我们一直在说要去海滩度假。我当时就应该告诉鲍勃，我这周末忙，已经有安排了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别傻了。你们两个能在一起多待一会，就应该多待一会儿", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "。而且我们随时都可以去海滩。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你理解。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "朋友就是要互相理解，不是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嘿，你说我们三个一起去海滩怎么样？再说了，你和鲍勃有一阵子没见面了。我不想我最好的朋友和我的男朋友，成为完全的陌生人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，我倒不会担心这个。但我不想当电灯泡。你们两个应该有自己的独处时间。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道鲍勃不会介意的。你可以带个男伴过来，比如一直提到的那个酒吧男。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可能吧。。。我会考虑的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "山姆，我的股票怎么办？我会赔钱吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有可能。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你这是什么意思？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的意思是，如果你现在不卖掉你的股票，你很有可能最终会血本无归。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是这样吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。相信我的话。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想重做这张海报，但约翰和玛丽认为它已经足够好了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我站在你这边。这张海报需要重做。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们需要弄清楚我们花了多少钱，我们要花在什么地方。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我想我们应该多存一些。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的，好吧，好，把收据拿出来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "让我们看看。 上个月我们花了700美元的房贷，400美元的食品杂货，75美元的水电费，250美元的汽油，100美元的书和300美元的娱乐费用。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那是1825美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们把500美元存入储蓄账户，750美元存入股票账户。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "3075美元。我们的薪水加起来是3300美元。这意味着我们没有225美元的收据。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你毕业于哪所大学", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我毕业于松花大学。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你什么时候毕业的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "2002年。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请问这封信到香港的邮资是多少？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我得检查一下。你还需要什么吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯嗯，请给我五张一美元的邮票。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "总共十四美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我打碎了妈妈的花瓶。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她会杀了你的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在吗，玛丽？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我回来了。我对这尊佛像的出价仍然是最高的！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我的邮票多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你不想听更多关于我佛像的事吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不要操之过，那个小胖子还不是你的呢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别说它是胖子！你有时真的很没礼貌。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "亲爱的，我该用哪只手拿叉子？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "左边是叉，右边是刀。记住，强壮的的那只手是拿刀子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "知道了。吃西餐太麻烦了。我已经学了几个小时餐桌礼仪了，但还是学不懂。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。比起吃，吃西餐更多的是关于西方文化。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊。我们今晚要去哪家餐馆？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "辛迪在市区一家新开的西餐厅为我们预订了一张桌子。她说那里的环境非常宜人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。我相信辛迪的品味。哦，我该穿什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你应该穿上我上周给你买的那套黑色西装。但恐怕有点皱了。你最好现在就熨。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不想把事情搞砸。请帮我做一下吧。我要去银行兑现一些钱。我们需要多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有必要那样做。我想这家餐馆接受信用卡。但有必要看看预算。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "亲爱的，你是个好会计。所以我最好把这个也留给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好像都是我做。那么你怎么办？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我来处理订单。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那好吧。嗯，开胃菜50元，晚餐200元，葡萄酒200元。别的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别忘了甜点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，那么甜点50元。总共500元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你的邀请。祝你生日快乐，茱莉亚。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢你的礼物。很高兴你能来。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，请给我账单好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "总共100美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可以用私人支票付款吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。这是您的收据，您可以在海关提取这些货物的税款。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "凯西，你喜欢旅行吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢旅游，度假很开心。但是我不喜欢上班，等公交车，或者。。。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "或者在开车的时候堵车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可以点外卖吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们今天只有春卷可以外卖。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我要四份可以吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然可以，夫人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "需要很长时间吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不会，几分钟就好了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "看，吉米的成绩单今天到了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "来看看。这是什么？成绩都在哪里啊？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "萨姆，他上的是三年级！你看他在学校里上的每一门课，都会得到一到三级不等的级别。一级意味着他的学习成绩是优秀的。比如科学课上他是二级，就是说他的成绩是令人满意的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "体育课成绩怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他得了三级，说明成绩令人不满意。我们应该和他一起努力。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太令人费解了！在我那时候，如果成绩好，会得A或B，如果考试不及格，会得F！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "先生，有什么事吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想给自己和妹妹买一个游戏。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你喜欢什么样的游戏？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "肯定是大型游戏。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，但游戏有各种各样的。你喜欢玩什么类型的游戏？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "类型？我不知道，都有什么类型？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有7种类型的游戏", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我是个初学者。我", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "别担心。很多男生都玩第一人称射击、实时策略、动作或运动游戏，而女生则更喜欢模拟、动作或角色扮演类的。射击、动作和体育游戏需要灵活的动作，实时策略则需要你综合考虑。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "相对而言，我跟喜欢第一人称射击和动作游戏。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这样啊，那可以选《反击战》和《力量与魔法》。《反击战》是最热门的射击游戏之一，而《力量与魔法》系列情节很吸引人，场景也很有趣，深受女孩们的喜爱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，谢谢你。那我要这两个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想要最新版吗？如果你的电脑运行速度很快，新版本会更好，虽然旧版本更便宜，但新版本更刺激更有意思。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我要最新版的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那件夹克很酷。你从哪儿弄来的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我在尼泊尔度假时买的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能想象拥有一百万美元吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我知道有一些花钱的地方。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我也是。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "先买辆新车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这茶闻起来很香。这是什么茶？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是一种特殊的绿茶，名为龙井茶，产于浙江省。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "除了令人愉悦的气味外，它还有什么特别之处？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你可以看到它很好地保持了茶叶的原色。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在这个过程中，他们必须有一些特殊的方法来做到这一点。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可能吧。我喜欢绿茶。这是我的生活必需品之一。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那么，你每天都有\"喝茶时间\"吗？我是说，你有固定的时间喝茶吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不完全是。但我真的很喜欢饭后喝茶。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "喝茶有什么好处？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有很多好处。在炎热或温暖的日子里，茶有助于驱除热量，使人立刻感到凉爽和放松。此外，茶叶含有许多对人体健康有益的化学物质。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是不是说茶叶越浓越好?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不。经常喝过浓的茶对人的健康有害。所以别把茶泡得太浓。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "知道了。什么时候喝茶合适？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "一天中大部分时间都很好。但睡前不要喝茶。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "偶尔会引起失眠。好吧，趁着茶还没凉，我们先喝吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大连是一座美丽的城市。你觉得呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得是。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这里的气候宜人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大家经常这么说", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这个城市住起来真舒服。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然啦", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有其他城市能与之匹敌。这里是天堂。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，如果你在其它城市住久了，你会很喜欢上的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那是肯定的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "简！你穿的裙子真好看！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢。猜猜看要多少钱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "鲜艳的色彩、光滑的材质、精湛的工艺、柔和的线条。。。亲爱的，你穿起来真漂亮！不可能是便宜货。大概两百左右吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的报价太离谱了。它只花了我65美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那真是意外收获了！65美元是原价，还是折后价？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "都不是。在我把价格砍下来之前，我和卖家讨价还价了很久。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她要多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "她对这样的出价一定很生气，不是吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "完全没生气！她见得太多了，似乎已经习惯这样的讨价还价。这就是交易。她只是要求我出更高的价，说之前价格甚至高于70美元。她在撒谎！然后我问：\"60美元卖吗？\"她摇了摇头。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "然后你假装不买就走了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "好的，夫人。 没关系。 散热器里几乎没有水了。 这很危险，夫人。 您知道，由于太热，您的车可能会抛锚。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那么请加满水。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "我得把它挪开，这样我才能把自行车骑过去。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你怎么能这么不体谅人？那是不对的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常抱歉。我没想到你会这么介意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "下次不要那样做了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我保证。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "下午好。这就是要卖的房吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "你在这住了多久？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "住了二十年了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "二十年！确实很久。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我从1976年就来了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那你为什么要卖？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "因为我刚刚退休。想在乡下买一栋小房子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这房子多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "6850英镑。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可真不少！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "物有所值。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我喜欢这房子，但我还没想好。我得让妻子看看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "总是女人说了算。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我所有考试都过了，妈妈。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真棒！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在找课程吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，但我不确定该报名哪一个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在找什么样的课程？全日制还是夜校？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我白天要工作，所以我想找一个晚上可以上的夜校课程。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想要什么样的课程？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我需要提高我的英语水平。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想要一对一的私人家教还是小班课？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我认为一对一的课程对我来说太贵了，所以小班课就可以了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你考虑过我们的网课吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想我更喜欢面对面的教学。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那很好。如果你愿意，你可以报名参加课前评估。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那是干什么用的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们的一位有经验的教师面试你，给你安排一个最合适的班级。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你有关于这门课的小册子，我可以带回家看看吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。这本册子介绍了晚上英语课的情况。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢。今晚我会通读一遍，明天再给你打电话报名参加课程。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你要做什么？向她求婚。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我当然很激动。机会只有一次。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你应该趁热打铁。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说得对。我要和她谈谈那件事。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我在电视上看到北京龙潭湖公园有一个娱乐项目，蹦极。只是高度不够。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说多高能让人兴奋？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "世界上最高的蹦极地点位于南非齐齐卡马山，海拔216米。瑞士一个风景区的缆车有160米高。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道法国人在两座高楼之间安装了蹦极绳。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "据说蹦极最初是新几内亚土著人的一种成人仪式。人们站在30多米高的树枝上。他们的脚被拐杖捆着，从站立的地方跳了下来。当他们几乎到达地面时，他们突然停下来证明自己的勇敢，并表示自己能够独立地忍受生活的艰辛。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "幸运的是，现在已经没有这种\"成人礼\"了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能帮我给我女儿找件礼物吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您觉得她会想要台笔记本电脑吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得笔记本棒极了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大多数人都会喜欢Mac。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "事实上，她确实喜欢苹果。一台多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们的15英寸专业版只需2100美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她会很高兴的。给我来一台。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您做了个好决定。您想怎么付款？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "信用卡支付的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您在这里签字后，它就是您的了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她需要什么额外的东西吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这很好。如果她想要配饰，就再来找我们吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你真是帮了大忙。非常感谢。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "祝你今天愉快，谢谢你来这里购物。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你觉得这部电视剧怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，坦白说，我认为看看电视剧很浪费时间。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我同意，但还是有很多人看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但我不这么想。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好。我能和爱丽丝说话吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请稍等。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不好意思，她出去了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能告诉她汤姆·格雷来过电话吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我很乐意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我听说你妹妹出事了，是真的吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，一周前发生的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真是太令人遗憾了！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "幸运的是，她受伤不严重。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你弟弟怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他似乎对那个女孩很着迷。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你父母一定很担心他。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，他已经这样两个星期了。我们不知道该怎么办。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你和他谈过了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谈过。但他就是不听。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "妈妈，你额头上有纹身吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，是的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "呜呜呜！你太酷了！你还有什么瞒着我的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有体环吗？伸出舌头！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，看在皮特的份上。这是化妆品。我的眉毛掉了。我这样做是为了方便。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "算了吧，妈妈。我是你的A！我要让他们知道这件事！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "迈克，想都别想！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您有公寓要出租吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。我现在有一个单身公寓。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "它在哪里呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在市中心，靠近广场的位置。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "公寓配备家具吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，租金包括水电费的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那很好。我什么时候能去看房子？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "下周六怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "朱迪，你知道我们要花多少钱吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，是的。根据我们的行程，一共要花不少于13000 RIB。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么？太多了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "坐下来。我给你看一下我们的财政预算表。首先，我们在交通上花费将近4000 RIB。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "啊，交通总是要花很大一笔钱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那么我们住旅馆就得花一大笔钱。但是如果我们想省钱，我们可以选择不是太好的酒店。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，我担心的是，一旦我们选择了便宜的旅馆，住宿条件也不好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那样的话，我们可以选择青年旅馆。这是个不错的选择，干净又经济。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "先生，您要点什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想尝尝中国菜。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们这里供应多种风味的中餐。不知道您喜欢哪一种。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我没想好。你能给我推荐吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好。广东菜比较清淡，北京菜比较浓郁，四川菜很辣。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，我明白了。我想吃辣的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果是这样，我建议您尝尝四川菜。大多数川菜味道辛辣，但口味各不相同。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的？有什么特色菜吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "烤鸡和辣牛肉是我们的特色菜。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧。我要这两个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，我想把这个包裹寄到中国，还有明信片。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "很好。您需要一些明信片邮票，我也需要称一下包裹的重量。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。这个要多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那要看情况了。您想通过优先邮件、特快邮件还是标准邮件邮寄呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有什么区别？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "标准邮件可能需要15个工作日。优先要快一点，大约在5到8个工作日内到达。特快邮件是最快的，但也是最贵的。只需要三天，你就可以在线跟踪你的包裹。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道了，我不着急。就用优先邮件吧。请格外小心，包裹里的东西易碎。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，我怎么填这个空？婚姻状况是什么意思？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你结婚了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没，我还是单身。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哪你就填一个\"S\"。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我能为您效劳吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我要归还这些书。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这书怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "封皮掉了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你得赔偿损失。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "5美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还不算太糟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "确实不太糟。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不客气。祝您一天愉快！。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "噢，约翰，你还记得我们说了我们要开始好好吃饭了吗？采用新的健康生活方式？那都是垃圾食品！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哼！也对，那你买了什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然是健康食品！我买了一些全麦面包，脱脂牛奶，鲜鱼和有机胡萝卜。。。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有机？什么是有机？我们需要有机胡萝卜吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "它们种植过程没有使用任何对健康有害的化学物质。约翰，我们确实需要有机胡萝卜。。。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，有机蔬菜是绿色的选择，对吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，对环境更好，对我们也更好！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "等等，那个是。。。甜甜圈？他们是有机甜甜圈吗，凯莉？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢甜甜圈。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大家下午好。实验三点开始。你看过说明书了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，先生。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，现在有一些注意事项。首先，注意安全。。。现在，在实验室记录上签上你的名字，然后你就可以开始了。如果有什么问题，请告诉我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，老师。这台空压机坏了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你打开了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "需要我帮忙吗，女士？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请问，去纽约的飞机在哪里？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "首先您必须在4号柜台办理登机手续。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那边那个？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错。然后您需要沿着指示牌到85号门。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢。你帮了我大忙。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请问你妈妈是做什么的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我母亲在一家公司做会计。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她忙吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不总是，她年底很忙。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你认为我应该请鲍勃帮忙吗？他会来吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没问题。你了解他的。他是那种乐于助人的人。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "你好。鲍勃！我们两周来一直在努力学习功课。所以这个周末我们何不放松一下呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "可以！你有什么建议？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "去看戏怎么样？我听说《哈姆雷特》在国家剧院演出。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是这样吗？好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "（看着报纸）哦，天哪！这个周末国家剧院没有演出。所以我们只能去看电影了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "现在有什么电影？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想一下。。嗯。《飘》。星期六晚上在六家电影院上映。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来很有趣。哪一个电影院最近？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "啊。我想是皇室影院。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "什么时候开始？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们为什么不去看7:30的那场？我觉得会很方便。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但是我们就没时间吃饭了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你想早一点的还是晚一点去？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "啊。。。我想看晚一点的电影。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "然后，有一场在9:30。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我觉得可以。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哥们！太美了！我对她一见钟情了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是树下那个美人吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。没有比她更迷人的女孩了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "她是个男孩！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "隔壁的噪音真是太让人烦了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，太烦了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有些人一点都不为他人着想。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们要做点什么。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我想是的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们受不了了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们把CD放大声，行吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不想做。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我们该怎么办？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "要不给他们打电话？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好主意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你今晚愿意和我一起出去玩吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，我去不了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那明晚呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想去。但恐怕不行。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想知道你想不想去看戏。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "听起来不错。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的给我打个电话怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不。我最好不打。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "因为我觉得我丈夫不喜欢。谢谢你邀请我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我工作如此努力，以至于没有精力锻炼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那只是个借口。你总能找到时间锻炼。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但我总是长时间地努力工作。我常常没有时间吃午饭。然而，我还是越来越胖了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "比尔，你知道工作和锻炼不一样，工作有压力但不轻松。不吃饭也无助于减肥。其实，如果你不吃饭，你的身体只会储存脂肪。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道你是对的，但我能做什么呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不如去散散步，而不是每天晚饭后坐在沙发上看报纸？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但我会错过新闻的。我的工作中很重要的就是跟上中国的形势。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我知道。你有手提收音机吗？你可以一边听新闻一边保持健康。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好主意！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "怎么了，戴夫？你今天看起来很低落。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我没有通过英语考试。如何学好英语？你能给我一些建议吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，英语是一只\"纸老虎\"。只要勤于练习就可以打败它。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我做了很多阅读理解练习，也花了很多时间背英语单词。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我建议你每天大声朗读英语课文，多说英语。这有助于培养你的语感。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的？我来试试。也许下次我会得到高分。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你有年终奖吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我现在才知道有。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我刚才看到一条新闻，说有一群白种人因为对年终奖不满意，在办公室里打面粉仗。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们为什么要打面粉仗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们的年终奖是大米、面粉和油，而领导得到了1000元的购物卡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他们不满意？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "据说他们得到的礼物价值不到200元，根本没有用，因为他们不自己做饭。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但是浪费食物是多么可耻啊！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你好。这里是布朗医生的牙科诊所。有什么可以帮到您的？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗨，我是苏珊·史密斯。我打电话是想问一下我今天3点预约的布朗医生见面", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "发生什么事了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我得了流感。我发烧头痛。我可以取消预约吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然可以，但是你要付10美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，要收费吗？为什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是延迟取消的费用。因为这个时间是留给你的。如果您不能预约，请提前48小时通知我们。否则，将收取费用。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我懂了。没关系。我会付钱的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你的理解。你想再约个时间吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不。现在不行。当我感觉好些的时候，我会再打电话给你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，保重。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢你", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我有个很好的主意，你可以租辆车直接开过去。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你疯了吗？如果我的朋友看到我开着租来的车，他们会怎么想", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但这是让你的计划成功的最快方法。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，这太难了！好吧，我看看我能做什么。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你找到好看的树了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。真是太美了。你想把它放哪儿？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们把它放在那边吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们去忙吧。我们想在半晚前给让这棵树装好灯。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们先把灯串起来，这样就不用把装饰弄乱了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "递给我一些地球仪和纸花，我要把它们放在上面的树枝上。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "在那里。。。我们差不多完了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我们开灯吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的来吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，我想我们都准备好迎接快乐的圣诞节了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "下午好，小姐，可以为您效劳吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想买这件衣服。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这的确是件漂亮的衣服。你可以在我这儿的收银机付款。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "太好了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您是用现金、支票还是信用卡付款？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想用信用卡。你们收Discover卡吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对不起，我们不收。我们只收Master或Visa卡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那我就用我的Visa。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的，女士。噢，还有一个问题，此卡无效。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "肯定是系统出了问题。那试试我的Master卡吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。谢谢你。好了，这次有用。总共199美元，请在这儿签名。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "给你，这是收据。祝您愉快。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "谢谢。也祝您愉快。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "怎么了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "看那些盘子！我都跟你说了三次了把这些盘子收起来。但是现在。。。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，别生气。我只是觉得你可能用得到。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我告诉过你了我不用了。真正让我恼火的是你对我装傻。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "周末愉快。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你也一样。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能告诉我您的大学吗，史密斯先生？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我是耶鲁大学的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是吗？你学的是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我经济学拿了A。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你介意告诉我你多大了吗?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我27岁。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能告诉我你还做过什么其他的工作吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，我在银行工作了几年。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在银行的薪水是多少？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我一周赚500美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "汤姆在吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "（是，）请讲。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有从Sons到PHS的巴士吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你说的Sons在哪个位置？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "Sons在Fair Oaks和Orange Grove路上。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你要坐两辆公共汽车到那。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "坐哪路公共汽车？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "首先，你得坐268号往西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "然后呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你得在Fair oaks和华盛顿路下车。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "下一步是什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "上261路就能到Sons了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有别的了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "就这些。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的公寓是什么样呀？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是一套带家具的两居室公寓，位置在校园的一栋三层楼上。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "住在校内宿舍里是什么感觉呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没有我想象的那么差。住在附近的大一新生非常吵，特别是在周末。但这里租金比私人住房便宜得多，所以是值得的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你们需要付定金吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用，但我们需要在6个月内支付9个月的租金，所以在前6个月，我们每月支付1/2个月的租金。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "需要在月租金的基础上另外支付水电费吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不用，这些都包括在费用内了。而且学生是不需要缴纳地方税的，所以我们住在这里省了不少钱。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的合同期是多久？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是不太好的一点，合同六月份就到期了，所以我们马上需要找一套新公寓了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你已经开始找房了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "还没有。我在想，如果学生们都离开这个城市去过暑假了，我们会找到便宜的住房的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "祝你好运！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "早上好，先生。您有预约吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。我叫查尔斯。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。我们为您预留了一张靠窗的桌子。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你真是太好了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "您现在点菜还是等一会儿？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请把菜单给我。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "直到现在还没有一封邮件？已经十二点了。真不敢相信！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真受不了，对吧？我也曾有过这样的经历。如果没有人给我打电话或发短信，我会觉得不舒服，感觉少了什么东西。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，没错。如果没人给我发短信，我会发疯的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "实际上，这是一种被称为\"信息狂躁症\"或\"信息过载\"的成瘾现象。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "成瘾？经常查看电子邮件和短信可以被称为成瘾吗？不可能！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "确实有这样的说法。你是否认为频繁查看邮箱是你工作日不可缺少的一部分？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "无论你走到哪里，你都带着手机，不时地查看短信和电话？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，这是必须的。否则，我可能会错过重要的电话和短信。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当你使用电脑时，你会打开所有的即时通讯工具吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "对。MSN、QQ、Skype、Google Talk、阿里旺旺，一切通讯工具，它们让我与所有亲朋好友保持联系。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "现在我可以告诉你，你肯定是因为信息泛滥而出现了成瘾现象。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你开始写报告了吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我找信息很难。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这很简单。你只需要在网上搜索就可以得到你想要的信息。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "噢，没想到。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你今天中午吃了什么?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我只吃了一个三明治，一包薯片，喝了瓶苏打水。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你在哪儿买的?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我去自助餐厅买的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你点了什么三明治?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我点了火腿三明治，但他们却给了我一份大腊肠三明治。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "它好吃吗?", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我挺喜欢，虽然我没有点这个。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我以前在那里点过三明治。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是这样吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是的，他们也把我点的东西弄混了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许是真的，不过我敢肯定你很喜欢你的三明治。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "亲爱的，你为什么这么生气？你能告诉我吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你不爱我，罗伊。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你为什么说这样的话？我非常爱你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不，你以前是爱我的。但现在不爱了。你爱上了别人。你爱上了我的朋友珍妮特。你更喜欢她。你觉得她既漂亮又有趣，你觉得我又笨又没意思。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "苏珊，我上个星期只和她出去吃了顿午饭。没什么好嫉妒的。相比珍妮特我更喜欢你的陪伴。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我嫉妒她，也恨她。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "亲爱的，你应该知道我非常爱你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，闭嘴，罗伊。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "但是亲爱的，我觉得你很棒。没有什么。。。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "哦，闭嘴！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请帮我接五月花餐厅好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "等一下", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "抱歉，占线了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没事，我稍后再试。还是要谢谢你。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "不客气。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可以和汤姆讲话吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "他现在和别人在一起，你能等一下吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "丹，丹，伙计。你得马上到我家来！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你还好吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "快过来！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "进来！快快快！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的房子怎么变成银行了？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你什么意思？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我是说，你窗户上怎么装上锁和铁条了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为了安全，丹，安全！安全设施永远不嫌多！外面有很多神经病的。就在前几天，他们当场抓住了那个偷窥狂！他的窗边架着一架高倍望远镜和双筒望远镜。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那你怎么了？怎么突然这么多疑？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "多疑？我才不是多疑好吗！我是小心谨慎！丹，我们必须时刻保持警惕！人们随随便便就侵犯你的隐私，对你了若指掌！电话推销员，律师，甚至你的银行也是！他们掌握了太多的信息了！我希望没有必要就不让别人知道我的信息。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，你找我想干什么？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你被监视了！小心点，丹！小心！", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想拍张照片。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好的。您喜欢哪种？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我喜欢半身的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没关系。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我这里有一些自己拍的照片。你想看看吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "当然。说到照片，哪种类型的胶卷最好？你知道，我打算去九寨沟旅游。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我会买富士200胶卷拍自然美景。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "非常感谢。你是个专家。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "今天我们一起吃午饭吧。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "这是个好主意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想要一个汉堡包和冰淇淋。你呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我不喜欢汉堡包。他们没有味道。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "奶酪蛋糕或苹果派怎么样？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "也许我想要个苹果派。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我可以抽烟吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "请讲。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你脸色苍白，身体一定不好。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "是啊。你说的对。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "为什么不去看医生呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "哦，你是说看手相。我以前见过，但我不相信。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你确定？我读过很多关于手相术的书，我能根据一个人的手掌说出很多准确的事。你想让我看看你的手吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "真的吗？你读过这方面的书吗？那好吧。但只要你愿意。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "好吧，让我看看，好吧，你有一条很长的生命线，这很好，而爱情线很强。。。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "是啊，但有时候宾果想和我玩游戏，我没时间。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那么谁来照顾它呢？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我弟弟喜欢和它一起玩。他甚至每周给它洗个澡。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "知道了。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "如果你有时间，我想和你谈谈。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "怎么回事？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我想谈谈我的租约。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你有什么疑问？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你能告诉我租约什么时候到期吗？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "你的租约是三年。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "是的，但她就是这样的。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我真不敢相信有女孩能这么对自己的身体。况且仅仅是为了某些方面好看。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "嗯，这不仅仅是女孩的错。也是社会的错——那些杂志和广告上都是瘦瘦的模特，说明瘦很流行。她们很难忽视。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "没错，但是要有个度。瘦是一回事；饿死是另一回事。没有人逼她们这么做。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "精装本多少钱？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "25美元。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "有点贵，但我还是买一本吧。这是25美元，给您。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "大卫，你为什么不打扫房间？", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "我没心情。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}

{"text": "但她对我很重要。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
{"text": "那就原谅她的错误。", "lang": "zh", "source": "dailydialog"}
